KZ 1.0 Change Log

===============================================================================
2023-06-07  New Profile KZ 1.0
===============================================================================
As of today, 07 Jun 2023, I am starting new new MO2 Profile, KZ 1.0.
KZ 0.9.4 is now a frozen snapshot of a working - but far from finished - modlist.
Specifically, I am no longer regarding my modlist as a strict extension of TPFZS, as I've changed too much, and will be unable to directly integrate future TPFZS updates.
All my custom mods are being renamed to v0.9.4 and new v1.0 copies are being created.
New MO2 separators will be introduced.
Mod and load orders will be seriously altered.

	Female Hands Redone 1.0
	https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/90713
	A complete overhaul for hands with 16 additional BodySlide sliders! Compatible with any textures!
	DL: Hands Redone F CBBE 1.0 21 may 2023
	- Hands Redone is a cosmetic overhaul for hands that attempts to recreate them with more realistic proportions. If you've ever looked at your character's hands and thought they were a little too chunky then this one's for you. These new hands were adapted to the vanilla UV mapping so that all your texture mods will remain compatible and seamless.
	- This mod also comes with 16 new sliders for BodySlide that allow you to tweak and customise your hands to your heart's content. Is it overkill? Absolutely! Does it look cool? You bet!
	- This mod is the culmination of something like 3-4 years of procrastination so I hope you find some good uses for them. Feel free to upload your screenshots if you've got em, but keep it PG.
	- If you're looking for an alternative that's slightly smaller in scope, check out CBBE hand meshï»¿ by khisartin/Letho0036; it's excellent!

	Simple Outfit System 0.2.3 wSkeever
	https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/48974
	Set NPC outfits or reset them back to their original outfits. MCM to manage up to 50 NPCs
	- Inspired by Simple NPC Outfit Manager, but improved.
	- Description
		Give unique outfits for up to 50 NPCs
		Reset NPCs back to their original outfits
		MCM to keep track of NPCs
		MCM to configure who you can manage the outfit of
		Edit existing outfits: add or remove items
		Get your items back when you reset outfits
		Avoids vanilla bug where setting outfits will erase certain equipped follower inventory items. This bug is not currently addressed by simple npc outfit manager.
		Avoids vanilla bug where changing outfits will erase duplicate follower inventory items. This bug is not currently addressed by simple npc outfit manager.
		Dismissed followers won't lose their outfits like with trading
		Able to set empty (naked) outfit in case you want to manage follower inventory with trading dialog
		ESL
	- Limitations
		- Outfits can't consist of player-enchanted or improved items, only base items. You won't lose them if you set an outfit with them, but NPCs will only wear the base items. If you want followers to wear improved/enchanted items, give it to them via trade dialog. This limitation currently also exists for simple npc outfit manager.
		- This mod will preserve duplicate copies of items in follower inventories. However, if you give an NPC player-improved/enchanted items and then reset their outfits, you might not be able to trade those exact improved items back, so grab those before resetting. Simple npc outfit manager will actually erase all duplicates, so if you set an npc to use an item and give that npc the same item via trading, both copies of that item will be erased when you set another outfit.
	- Q: What's the difference between this and Simple NPC Outfit Manager?
	- A: Here is a list of differences:
		Feature:
		Simple outfit system allows you to reset npc outfit back to original.
		Simple npc outfit manager does not.
		Feature:
		Simple outfit system allows you to disable the dialog via MCM.
		Simple npc outfit manager does this via console commands.
		Feature:
		Simple outfit system allows you to set the relationship rank for which the dialog appears via MCM.
		Simple npc outfit manager does this at 2 levels (friend vs all) via download options.
		Bug-fix: 
		Simple outfit system prevents followers from losing equipped items when you set their outfit. 
		Simple npc outfit manager does not.
		Bug-fix:
		Simple outfit system tries to preserve multiple copies of the same item in follower inventories when changing outfits.
		Simple npc outfit manager does not.
		Bug-fix:
		Simple outfit system handles empty outfits.
		Simple npc outfit manager does not update until location change.

	- Refreshing yourself will grant you a 25% bonus to Resist Disease & give you a +5 to Speechcraft.

	KEEP Mopy [Wrye Bash]
	Disable almost all mods that contain Root folders - specifically, tools like SSEEdit, DynDOLOD, etc
	KEEP the following Root Mods:
		Serio's ENB (now renamed)
		CK64Fixes - contains dlls from SSE Engine Fixes, possibly overridden - need more work to be sure
		ENBSeries 0.493 (a new mod, updated from the ENB in TPFZS)
		SKSE64 2.0.20 for SSE 1.5.97  (newly packaged mod)
	RootBuilder Tool:

		Create Backup
		Create Cache
		Build

PATCH DynDOLOD/EditScripts/DynDOLOD/DynDOLOD_SSE.ini
	Based on Patches from How to Keep Your Skyrim Alive Guide
	â Within the DynDOLOD folder, navigate to the âEdit Scriptsâ folder.
	â Navigate to the folder within that also named âDynDOLODâ.
	â Double click to open the file âDynDOLOD_SSE.iniâ.
	â If necessary, tell Windows to open it in Notepad.
	â Find the line (line 52) which reads âIgnoreLargeReferences=0â.
	â Change the â0â to a â1â.
	â Close the file and confirm saving any changes
	From the ini file itself:
	; Because Bethesda simply does not comprehend people are modding exterior worldspaces ...
	; set to 1 if uLargeRefLODGridSize=5 (value of uGridsToLoad) in SkyrimPrefs.ini, do this if it is certain that the large references system will not be used, so that no DynDOLOD.esm is created

	xLODGen Resource - SSE Terrain Tamriel Extend 1.0		INSTALL https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/54680?tab=files

RUN xLODGen
	Following combo of instructions in Keep your Skyrim Alive Guide and https://dyndolod.info/Help/xLODGen
	â When the program window appears, check all the checkboxes in the âworldspacesâ list box at the left.
	â At the right, uncheck the checkboxes next to the bolded text âObjects LODâ, âTrees LODâ, and âOcclusionâ. Only âTerrain LODâ should be enabled.
	â In the âTerrain LODâ field:
	â Under the âSettings forâ drop down menu, select âLOD32â.
	â Under BOTH âFormatâ drop down menus, select âBC7 Maxâ.
	- xLODGen Help:
	- says set to 'BC7 Quick'
	- Typically use a Quality of 0 to 10 for LOD32 and set Optimize Unseen to 550 to improve coastlines on the map.
	- Lower values for quality mean better quality at the cost of more performance, with 0 being the best possible quality. The better the quality the larger the file size of the terrain LOD meshes. If performance is of concern use the higher values - even higher that suggested if necessary..
	Typically check both Build diffuse and Build normal.
	- For all LOD4, LOD8, LOD16 and LOD32 set both Format drop-downs to BC7 Quick if available or DXT1 if not or in case video memory usage is of concern. Using BC7 Max will typically only make generation time take much longer without any visual improvement.
	- Typically set Size to 512 or 1024 for LOD32.
	â At the bottom of the program window, click the âGenerateâ button. The operation will take some time.

		- A SKSE64 plugin that makes characters appear wet when in water and optionally in the rain or snow by dynamically applying glossiness/specularity to their skin, hair, armor and weapons. Works on the player and NPCs. Once out of the water, the character begins drying. Soak/dry times can be changed, transitions are seamless.
		- Works with ENB wet surfaces and mods which use shaders for wet effects (water drip for example) or change body specular map textures to give a more detailed wet look to actors. If you feel the specular effect is too high you can lower it in the config (MaxSpecularStrength).
		- Configuration: Specular strength, glossiness, water level threshold and soak/dry transition speeds are configurable in SoakingWet.ini. Player/NPC effects can be toggled separately.

	SSE Creation Kit Fonixdata Lip Sync Fix 1.0 
		https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/40971
		This is the fonixdata file that is missing in the Creation Kit for Skyrim SSE. It is just a quicker way to get the file then downloading Fallout creation kit and grabbing the file that way. If your Lip Sync still wont work in CK, try it in tandem with Nuukem's mod FaceFXWrapper 0.3 should fix that nasty sse Lip Sync issue in the Creation Kit.
		- SOOOOOOOO.... before we get started I am not a mod/fix master. I am just another human stumbling thru chats and forums to figure out common glitches. With that being said I found myself  searching for the missing Fonixdata File, which is needed for your CK created NPC to move his lips. The Fix I saw was to download another CK and steal that file from that. I didn't want to do that and I'm sure no one would if given the option to get it from Nexus .So I just wanted to make it available without downloading another Creation Kit to get it. I was given the file by a fellow modder and thought I would share it on Nexus.
		- Mod Manager Install 
			1-Just download it like any other mod\fix.
			2-If your CK Lip sync still has issues follow the steps below, This is the way I had to get it to work.
		- The Steps You Must Walk
			1-Download Nuukems  FaceFXWrapper 0.3. I would suggest Downloading the CK Fixes as well, they are a great help to modding.  https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/20061?tab=files.
			2-After that download the folder on this page and Extract the contents of the folder into the Skyrim voice folder (folder Name Is Processing)
ï»¿				It will look like this- Skyrim Special Edition>Data>Sound>Voice (In voice is where you place the file)
			3- The load Ck and test it out. For me it worked great, if you are still having issues with lip sync let me know and I will ask those wiser then me for a follow up solution

		Requirements:  Botox for Skyrim (assets only)
		see https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17392 for description:
			The entire reason high fantasy exists is because of the idea at the core of this mod. You want to rescue the damsel from the dragon, and with a little luck, she'll show you her underwear. Tell me I'm wrong, fool.
			10 NPCs, 14 new UNP clothing items, 4 new potion items. Free the girls before the dragons get them!
			Panicked villagers are sacrificing maidens to the dragons! No quests, just approach the NPC and speak.
			The girls' families have sedated them against pain and horror with Sleep Thorn! It's so strong that the girls might even be oblivious while the dragon attacks! You must tell them to run, and you might have to tell them more than once. When they regain clarity they will stop talking and flee in terror to a nearby city, even if the dragon is dead. They are not essential and can die en route! After they get to safety they might not speak for a while.
			THE GIRLS: GLAMOUR MODS ABOUND; THIS IS NOT ONE. They are vanilla + UNP only. My screencaps use Adorable Face and Younger Bretons, loaded after (below) this mod. Marriage availability depends on the voice of the NPC.* They are not adventurers and will flee from attack.  If you want them to follow you, you'll need a mod that can add them into that faction,** but wait until after they arrive at a safe place. It had to be done this way.
		This version includes some changes:
			No custom armor UNP; this mod uses your assets, and maidens use wedding dresses.
			Maidens now have botox for Skyrim and a custom face for Bump; the orc has a custom face made by Racemenu.
			ESL Plugin.
			The cookie recipe is intact.
			Some important notes:
			I used base ENB with FairSkin; no other mod was used for screenshots.
			The maidens can die, but I added respawn time to make things easier.
			I suggest rescuing them before dragons appear.
		KZ Notes: i plan to tweak the hell out of this mod, mostly to change maiden appearance and clothing.

	Arissa - Default Body plus Dialog Fix 1.0   UPDATED INFO - ALREADY INSTALLED
		https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/42187
		Changes Arissa (version 2.2.2) to use your default body meshes and textures, and fixes her "What do you know about this place?" silence.
		This mod changes Arissa - The Wandering Rogue (version 2.2.2) to use your default body meshes and textures.
		"But don't we already have one of those?"
			Yes, Arissa - The Wandering Rogue (Default Body and Texture patch) also has Arissa using default body meshes and textures. The way it handles the head textures differs from this mod, but the result is the same.
		"Then why did you make this patch?"
			A few reasons:
			1) That mod, for no obvious reason, changes her default outfit. Arissa's default outfit, named "_Arissa_BaseOutfit" in the mod, is the stock ClothesMerchantClothes and ClothesMerchantBoots. Mod 19441 says it "reassigns her default armor to a simple vanilla game hide armor to avoid having her body clip through her armor", but that doesn't make sense; her DOFT is already "simple vanilla game...armor". In fact, all of Arissa's outfits are stock items (there are no armor/clothing meshes in the mod); the ESM just gives one set different names ("Thieves Guild Variant XXX" becomes "Weatherworn Burglar's XXX").
			- Arissa's original body is a CBBE variant; as shown in the image, having her equip a UNP-based armor will result in the usual texture mismatches. With this patch in place, she will match your default body textures.
			Perhaps of greater interest:
			2) This mod is ESL-flagged; Mod 19441 is not, so it takes up a limited non-FE load-order slot even though it contains zero non-override records.
			3) This mod, thanks to Reddit user AmechanosIason, makes her "What do you know about this place?" dialog work, albeit with an extra click of the pointer. The dialog isn't that exciting--it's basically repeats of some of her random-idle comments--but the non-working conversation topic seems to bother some people, so this mod turns it back on.
		NOTE: If you use an appearance replacer for Arissa, like Froztee's excellent Arissa Re-Imagined SE, load this patch before that replacer. That way, this patch will apply the fix for the dialog, and the appearance replacer will determine how Arissa looks.

		https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12352
		Some spell and runes that force targets to unequip gear.
		This is an independent version created by users request, which includes some spells from Bodytypes of Skyrim mod.
		There are 2 version: default version (spell tomes and staffs are added to player inventory), and alternative version with tomes stored in hidden places inside chests (if you want to know location, read spoiler at the end).
		You can find some spell tomes to learn these spells:

	Frigitta the Frost Witch 1.21 Kalambre  NEW INSTALL
		https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/84639
		A mage follower which enjoys undressing and freezing enemies.
		Frigitta loves the cold and cold loves her, she likes to walk barefoot and wearing skimpy clothes to feel the cold breeze in a snowy day, and obviously, her favorite season is winter. She enjoys freezing her enemies to death, sharing with them her passion for cold.
		There are many rumors about her origin, some of them say her parents died when she was a baby, they were surprised by a strong blizzard when the family was traveling along Skyrim, and only Frigitta survived. Other stories say she was abandoned in a snowy forest by her father, when he discovered her magical skills, and was raised by witches. Anyway, seems that cold can't hurt her, and she feels confortable in frozen places.
		Some time ago, she was admitted to Winterhold college, thanks to her mastery with frost spells, but she was looking for new ways to improve these spells and developed new versions capable of undress targets, increasing freezing effects. This behavior was perceived as indecent by the Archmage and other masters, so, she was expelled from college. Actually, she wanders near Winterhold, waiting for someone that appreciate her special skills, leading her on new adventures.
		ABILITIES:
			She is a mage (Breton race), focused on frost magic with these spells/abilities:
			-Ice Spike and Frostbite improved: similar to original spells, but undress targets if they are dressed and apply a frost weakness.
			-Conjure frost Atronach
			-Conjure Ice Wraith spell
			-Frost cloak: Auto enabled when character is in combat, undress nearby enemies
			-Passive abilities: 100% frost resistence, 20% fire resistence (too cold to burn...)
			-Mage armor effect applied if no wearing armor
			-Healing spell
			-Heal rate increased when snowing
			*She also has a Ice Spike and Frostbite staff on inventory (in case she spend all her mana).
		Requires: Nude Spells

		An Evening With Angi 1.1 CHIMinyCricket
			https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/74499
			Angi invites you in for dinner. Perhaps she just wants company, perhaps she wants something more...
			DL: An Evening With Angi ESL Version 1.1 12 sep 2022
			A very short quest where you spend some alone time with your favorite wild archer, Angi. To start the mod, just finish Angi's archer training and talk to her afterwards. If you don't know who Angi is, she's the archer who lives on a mountain near Falkreath and gives you archery lessons. Don't expect a feature length quest mod, this is very short and to the point. If it isn't already clear, this is an adult mod where two adults do adult things to each other in a consensual and adult manor. Oh, and you don't have to do the quest during the evening, but I'd recommend you do it at that time for the mood lighting ;).
			OStim is required, so make sure you download it first.
			While you're here, why not grab my other mod Fertility Adventures (and its requirements) to make things a little more interesting? It isn't required, just thought I'd mention it.
			I made this mod months ago, but I never got around to releasing it. I'd be interesting in doing a large scale version of this with other NPCs in the future. If you're interested in that sort of thing, then let me know what you think of this mod, I'm open to feedback. Perhaps you'd also consider joining my Patreon. Even joining for $1 and leaving the next month would be more than 99% of people would give for free content. Shoutout to Boshilo for being a long time supporter. Whatever you decide to do, I hope you have a good day.
			Compatibility
				The mod is compatible with any Angi face replacer and Better Living for Angi.
			Q: What Angi replacer is that?
			A: It's from the Northbourne NPC replacer series.
			Q: Why Angi?
			A: I always felt that Angi typically flies under people's radar. She's actually pretty fleshed out for a random NPC you find in the middle of nowhere (by Skyrim standards). Most NPCs of that sort are pretty generic and only have one or two lines of dialogue.
		
		GLAM Angi 1.0 GLAMbazoonga
			https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/63723
			a visual NPC overhaul of the archery teacher lady, Angi, making her look glamorous, gorgeous, rustic, cunning, survivalist
			DL: GLAM Angi - custom body and skin (recommended)
				GLAM Angi - REALORE Skin
				Angi face preset
			She is a lonely girl living on a mountain.
			She used to live in Helgen but had to leave.
			She is an outlaw, hiding there from the authorities.
			She took revenge on the drunken Imperial soldiers who killed her parents.
			She does not know that no one will come to arrest her from Helgen.
			She is so kind so she teaches you archery for free.
			She shows you the secrets of using the bow correctly.
			She trains you until you improve your archery a lot.
			This is Angi.
			This is my version of Angi, as I imagine she should look. 
			This is my vision of her. I made her look pretty glamorous, gorgeous, cute but slightly ragged too, more natural realistic. 
			She looks like a young Nord woman who spends her days outdoors, a blonde-readhead with freckles
			The mod is a makeover of Angi. It is *fully standalone*. It includes a face that is High Poly, with hair, textures and a custom CBBE body. She has the body and skin I made for her.
			She has a messy bright ginger hair, tied in the back of her head, falling on her shoulders. 
			Her lips are thick, but not a lot.  
			She has blue-violet eyes with not thick eyelashes and unique warpaint around her eyes.
			She has some freckles on her face and rough face complexion.
			This face was inspired from the look of the actress Emma Roberts.
			Her custom CBBE body made by me is thin and lean. 
			I used customised bijin Skin 4K.
			optional:
			* REALORE Skin (very recommended!)
			* less ragged face (good for harsh ENBs or no ENB)
