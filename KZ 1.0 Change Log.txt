KZ 1.0 Change Log

===============================================================================
2023-06-07  New Profile KZ 1.0
===============================================================================
As of today, 07 Jun 2023, I am starting new new MO2 Profile, KZ 1.0.
KZ 0.9.4 is now a frozen snapshot of a working - but far from finished - modlist.
Specifically, I am no longer regarding my modlist as a strict extension of TPFZS, as I've changed too much, and will be unable to directly integrate future TPFZS updates.
All my custom mods are being renamed to v0.9.4 and new v1.0 copies are being created.
New MO2 separators will be introduced.
Mod and load orders will be seriously altered.

	Female Hands Redone 1.0
	https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/90713
	A complete overhaul for hands with 16 additional BodySlide sliders! Compatible with any textures!
	DL: Hands Redone F CBBE 1.0 21 may 2023
	- Hands Redone is a cosmetic overhaul for hands that attempts to recreate them with more realistic proportions. If you've ever looked at your character's hands and thought they were a little too chunky then this one's for you. These new hands were adapted to the vanilla UV mapping so that all your texture mods will remain compatible and seamless.
	- This mod also comes with 16 new sliders for BodySlide that allow you to tweak and customise your hands to your heart's content. Is it overkill? Absolutely! Does it look cool? You bet!
	- This mod is the culmination of something like 3-4 years of procrastination so I hope you find some good uses for them. Feel free to upload your screenshots if you've got em, but keep it PG.
	- If you're looking for an alternative that's slightly smaller in scope, check out CBBE hand meshï»¿ by khisartin/Letho0036; it's excellent!

	Simple Outfit System 0.2.3 wSkeever
	https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/48974
	Set NPC outfits or reset them back to their original outfits. MCM to manage up to 50 NPCs
	- Inspired by Simple NPC Outfit Manager, but improved.
	- Description
		Give unique outfits for up to 50 NPCs
		Reset NPCs back to their original outfits
		MCM to keep track of NPCs
		MCM to configure who you can manage the outfit of
		Edit existing outfits: add or remove items
		Get your items back when you reset outfits
		Avoids vanilla bug where setting outfits will erase certain equipped follower inventory items. This bug is not currently addressed by simple npc outfit manager.
		Avoids vanilla bug where changing outfits will erase duplicate follower inventory items. This bug is not currently addressed by simple npc outfit manager.
		Dismissed followers won't lose their outfits like with trading
		Able to set empty (naked) outfit in case you want to manage follower inventory with trading dialog
		ESL
	- Limitations
		- Outfits can't consist of player-enchanted or improved items, only base items. You won't lose them if you set an outfit with them, but NPCs will only wear the base items. If you want followers to wear improved/enchanted items, give it to them via trade dialog. This limitation currently also exists for simple npc outfit manager.
		- This mod will preserve duplicate copies of items in follower inventories. However, if you give an NPC player-improved/enchanted items and then reset their outfits, you might not be able to trade those exact improved items back, so grab those before resetting. Simple npc outfit manager will actually erase all duplicates, so if you set an npc to use an item and give that npc the same item via trading, both copies of that item will be erased when you set another outfit.
	- Q: What's the difference between this and Simple NPC Outfit Manager?
	- A: Here is a list of differences:
		Feature:
		Simple outfit system allows you to reset npc outfit back to original.
		Simple npc outfit manager does not.
		Feature:
		Simple outfit system allows you to disable the dialog via MCM.
		Simple npc outfit manager does this via console commands.
		Feature:
		Simple outfit system allows you to set the relationship rank for which the dialog appears via MCM.
		Simple npc outfit manager does this at 2 levels (friend vs all) via download options.
		Bug-fix: 
		Simple outfit system prevents followers from losing equipped items when you set their outfit. 
		Simple npc outfit manager does not.
		Bug-fix:
		Simple outfit system tries to preserve multiple copies of the same item in follower inventories when changing outfits.
		Simple npc outfit manager does not.
		Bug-fix:
		Simple outfit system handles empty outfits.
		Simple npc outfit manager does not update until location change.

	Disable almost all mods that contain Root folders - specifically, tools like SSEEdit, DynDOLOD, etc
	KEEP the following Root Mods:
		Serio's ENB (now renamed)
		CK64Fixes - contains dlls from SSE Engine Fixes, possibly overridden - need more work to be sure
		ENBSeries 0.493 (a new mod, updated from the ENB in TPFZS)
