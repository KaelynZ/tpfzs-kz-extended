TPFZS KZ Extensions - Questions for Zed

Since I'm not going to clog up a Discord forum or expect quick answers, I'm going to be a bit more detailed than I would be while chatting.  You may want to bring up SSEdit and get some coffee before delving in.

1.  Book edits in ZedPatch.   Two books, 02004d5B DLC1LD_AetheriumWars and 000c1771 Book2CommonLegendOf RedEagle, are *mostly* amerge of Book Covers Skyrim and TheChoiceIsYours.  However, they're missing a couple of properties from TCIY.  Looks like TCIY got updated, and your patch didn't include the updates, so I fixed in in my consistency patch.   Is this a correct analysis?

2.  Most of the time, ZedPatch copies cell lighting from Luminosity.  But every once in a while, it copies it from some other mod, making the Luminosity record red.  E.g. 0002529e MehrunesDagonShrine copies from Ryn's Mehrunes Dagon Shrine, and 00013a73 FalkreathLodsHouse copies from COTN - Falkreath.  Are these choices deliberate?

3.  Why did you go with Serana Relationship Revamped in instead of Serana Dialog Addon?

4. ZedPatch2 - Why did you remove some appearance edits from JKJ on some Khajiits?  I restored them in my consistency patch.

5.  ZedPatch2 - Why did you not use the appearamce edits from JKJ - Vaharardo's Jaguar Khayla?

6. ZedPatch - Why did you give so many starting skill boosts to Khajiits  (00013745 KhajiitRace), over Aetherius and JKJ? Are you a cat lover, by chance?  In any case, it's inconsistent with the other Khajiit races added by JKJ.  And why did you remove the Aetherius MAG_KhajiitRaceMonitor "Khajiit Race Monitor" [SPEL:FE0F4842] actor effect?

Answers:
Thank you for checking out the patches and giving me another set of eyes :)

1) This was entirely in error as you describe. Fixed for the next version

2) This is intentional. If another mod modifies those records (like Ryn's, or JKs overhauls), I will carry over their changes instead. My assumption is that they changed those values because they believe it fits their overhaul of the area generally better, so that's what I go with. There very well may be a couple Luminosity records I have simply not copied over by mistake, I'll check through the plugin to confirm that.

3) Personal preference. I prefer Laura Baily as Serana's voice actor. I have not installed Serana Dialogue Addon at any point, so I can make no comments on compatibility.

4-5) Looks like I did not do a very good job patching Khajiit NPCs. That was definitely an accident, and has been fixed for the next version.

6) I've observed those bad starting skills a few times but always forget to actually fix that. Is fixed! Regarding the KhajiitRaceMonitor effect, I wasn't sure if that was left out by the JKJ-Aetherius patch for a reason, so I followed suite with it. In hindsight looking at the record now, that was more than likely an error or it was made on an older version. That actor effect is now carried over.
