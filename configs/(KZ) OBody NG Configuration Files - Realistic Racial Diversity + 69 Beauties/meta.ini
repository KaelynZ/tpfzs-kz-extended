nexusDescription="[center][img]https://i.imgur.com/ps9nrFi.png[/img]\xfeff[/center]\n<br />\n<br />[size=3][b]READ the description carefully![/b] Below is, in detail, every piece of information regarding what this mod does, how it works, and how to make it work in your game. Failure to read the description will mean that this mod will not work when you boot up Skyrim. [b][u]I will not provide support if you don't read the description.[/u][/b]\n<br />\n<br />The original OBody made by [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/98523348]Sairion350[/url] is an SKSE plugin which distributes all of your installed Bodyslide presets to every NPC in the game, including your player character. This means you will have huge body variety in your game, and are no longer stuck to a single Bodyslide preset built in Bodyslide. Not only that, OBody also affects the actors bodies when clothed, having full support for all outfits, either vanilla or modded! The initial distribution is done randomly, but you can manually change the Bodyslide preset of any NPC or your player character ingame, in real time, in one click - and OBody will remember the Bodyslide preset that you applied!\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#c27ba0]OBody NG (Next Generation)[/color][/b] is a new version and a [u][b]replacement[/b][/u] of OBody compiled with CommonLibSSE NG - in other words, it means it works with every current Skyrim version, whether it is SE or AE - no need to hunt for a compatible DLL! Besides that, this version of OBody also ships with its own MCM menu, several bug fixes, a feature to check the current preset applied to the NPC, and with many new customisation options, such as setting presets by race, setting presets to each individual NPC before starting the game, blacklisting presets from random distribution and blacklisting NPCs from being touched by OBody. Keep reading for more details!\n<br />\n<br />Note that every mod that has the original OBody as a requirement will work with OBody NG. This means that you can use [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/64151]OPubes[/url] and similar mods with OBody NG. [b][u]NOTE[/u][/b], however, that since OPubes requires OStim, you must have OStim installed and use OBody NG for OStim. So, if a mod requires OBody, you must check if it also requires OStim.\n<br />\n<br />Keep reading for further details and for the full list of features, as well as installation instructions and Frequently Asked Questions.\n<br />\n<br />For support regarding installation or troubleshooting, I highly suggest you join the [url=http://discord.gg/RECvhVaRcU]OStim Discord[/url]. It's much easier to provide help through the Discord channel than on Nexus.\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#e69138]If you like my work and would like to further support me in some way, consider [url=https://ko-fi.com/aietos]sending me a tip on Ko-fi[/url].

Give it a few minutes to register. [b]Highly recommended to use [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/77336]OBody NG - Settings Loader[/url] alongside OBody NG for OStim to easily handle your MCM settings between new games[/b]. Do NOT use the OBody MCM options in the OStim MCM Addons tab. For OBody Standalone users, continue using the OBody Standalone MCM. Note that the linked Settings Loader mod does [b][u]NOT[/u][/b] work for the Standalone version!\n<br />\n<br />- [b]New feature:[/b] See which Preset is currently applied to the NPC/Player Character when you open the Presets list!\n<br />    [size=2]Note: You will see \"Unknown Preset\" for NPCs that you already met in your current save. I have no way of knowing which presets were applied in previous versions. So it will only start working if you change the presets of those NPCs manually, or for NPCs that you have not yet loaded in your current save.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />- [b]New feature:[/b]\xa0\x41 JSON configuration file where you can set preset distribution rules by race and by individual NPCs, as well as blacklist presets from the random distribution pool and blacklist NPCs from being touched by OBody! You can also blacklist outfits from being touched by ORefit - which is very useful for topless outfits!\n<br />\n<br />- Automatically distributes all of your installed presets randomly to the NPCs when they are loaded for the first time in your game. OBody remembers the presets assigned. If you install presets midgame, OBody will make use of them too! No need to run Bodyslide again when you add new presets, just go ingame and they're ready to use.\n<br />\n<br />- All presets can be assigned manually if you find that OBody assigned a preset to an NPC that doesn't fits them. Just press the O key (configurable in the MCM!) when the crosshair is on the NPC and the list of installed presets will appear. Select one and that's it, the NPC's body will change in real time, no extra input from you needed! You can do this as many times as you want.\n<br />\n<br />- If you want to change your player character's preset, just press the O key with no NPC on your crosshair.\n<br />\n<br />- You can assign a set of rules for body distribution in an XML file that OBody provides. For instance, you might want smaller breasts for Bosmer and wider hips for Nords. See further below for more details on how the OBody XML file configuration works.\xa0[b]Currently, this is only properly supported for CBBE based bodies, but it should work with variable results with BHUNP. Full BHUNP support is planned.[/b]\n<br />\n<br />- OBody has full and proper weight support. This means that, if a Bodyslide preset is thin at 0 weight and thick at 100 weight, NPCs who have 0 weight will be thin and NPCs who have 100 weight will be thick if they are applied that preset. This creates even more body variety ingame.\n<br />\n<br />- All vanilla and modded outfits are fully supported. Clothes will fit the bodies according to the weight and bodyslide preset assigned.\n<br />\n<br />- Bodyslide presets marked as Clothes/Outfit/Pushup and similar are automatically filtered out from the list of presets so you don't have to manually delete them.\n<br />\n<br />- Contains an algorithm called ORefit, enabled by default (can be disabled in the MCM), which simulates the effect of clothes on the body. This means that when you wear an outfit, the chest will automatically get a pushup effect without the need to assign a preset labelled Clothes/Outfit/Pushup. ORefit also works around the butt and hips, not just the chest! [b]ORefit is only currently supported for CBBE based bodies, but it works more or less decently with BHUNP[/b]. [b]Full support for BHUNP is planned.[/b]\n<br />\n<br />- Contains optional nipples and genital randomization (can be enabled or disabled in the MCM). [b]Currently, this only supports CBBE based bodies.[/b]\n<br />\n<br />- Both male and female bodies are fully supported as long as they have Bodyslide support (some of these bodies include HIMBO, Touched by Dibella, CBBE, CBBE 3BA, BHUNP, among many others)!\n<br />\n<br />- Most of OBody's code is executed on the SKSE side of things, which means the code is highly optimised and runs at the engine level - in other words, it's very high performance with little to no script lag![/size]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[center][img]https://i.imgur.com/Nd0Lzqr.gif[/img]\n<br />[i]OBody NG in action ingame[/i][/center]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[color=#c27ba0][size=5][b][center]Installation guide[/center][/b][/size][/color]\n<br />[b][size=3][color=#f4f4f4]If you are upgrading from the [/color][color=#c27ba0]original OBody\xa0[/color][color=#c27ba0](the one that requires OStim)[/color][color=#f4f4f4], simply [/color][color=#c27ba0]replace[/color][color=#f4f4f4] OBody with OBody NG.

If you download this optional file and install as a separate mod, you can write your configurations there. This way, you don't have to backup the contents of your configuration files when updating the OBody NG main file.\n<br />\n<br />To update OBody NG main file, simply uninstall the old version and install the new one. Unless stated otherwise, it's 100% safe to update OBody NG midgame. You don't need to do anything else.\n<br />[/size]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[color=#c27ba0][size=5][b][center]How to configure the OBody NG JSON and XML Configuration Files[/center][/b][/size][/color]\n<br />[center][b][size=5]Please [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/articles/4756]read this article[/url] to know how to configure the JSON and XML configuration files.[/size][/b][/center]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[color=#c27ba0][size=5][b][center]Frequently Asked Questions[/center][/b][/size][/color]\n<br />[color=#c27ba0][size=3][b]1) Should I use this or AutoBody?[/b][/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />[size=3]I've been getting asked this a lot, so I decided to put this here. Functionally speaking, OBody NG and AutoBody do the same thing. And no, you obviously can not use both at the same time. I thought I didn't need to say this, but someone tried to do this once and then pestered me about why OBody NG wasn't working in his game. Yes, people can be that dumb.\n<br />\n<br />To actually answer the question about which you should use: OBody NG currently has more features than AutoBody. OBody NG has more customization options, and its JSON file is more powerful and more user friendly than AutoBody's ini file.\n<br />\n<br />AutoBody is also no longer under development, while OBody NG still receives updates regularly. More features and optimisations are always being added.\n<br />\n<br />Another problem with AutoBody is that it doesn't work with BHUNP - most presets end up coming out borked with incorrect proportions... [url=https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/771971253451620369/1050447005761151037/ScreenShot9.png]like this[/url]. OBody NG fully supports BHUNP, without issues! All of the screenshots in the Images section were taken with BHUNP body. OBody NG also obviously works with all CBBE based bodies.\n<br />\n<br />Another advantage of OBody NG is, as I said earlier in the description, it works with every version of Skyrim! It doesn't matter if you are on SE, AE, VR or GOG. OBody NG works with all of them, and you do not need a specific version of OBody NG for your Skyrim version. The same OBody NG version works with every Skyrim version! And no, OBody NG does not necessarily depend on OStim - simply choose the OBody NG Standalone version in the installer!\n<br />\n<br />If you are currently using AutoBody, I do not recommend switching to OBody NG [b]unless you are starting a new game[/b]. A user made the switch from AutoBody to OBody NG mid-game successfully, but it has the potential to be a time consuming process, and, above all, removing mods midgame can break your saves! So, if you're thinking about making the switch to OBody NG - only do it if you're starting a new game, OR if you were [b]not[/b] using AutoBody in your current save.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#c27ba0][size=3]2) Nothing works!![/size][/color][/b]\n<br />\n<br />[size=3]Make sure you followed [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/articles/4580]the installation guide[/url]. Make sure you read every single word of it and followed each and every step. Failure to do so will mean OBody will never work.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=3]If you hate reading, then this mod (and honestly, modding in general) isn't for you.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#c27ba0][size=3]3) I have followed the guide, but NPCs still have all the same body.[/size][/color][/b]\n<br />\n<br />[size=3]Save the game, exit the game, and reload your save. Sometimes OBody needs this for the first time to start applying presets.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#c27ba0][size=3]4) That still didn't work. Why?[/size][/color][/b]\n<br />\n<br />[size=3]Either you did something wrong while installing or you don't have RaceMenuMorphsCBBE.esp or RaceMenuMorphsBHUNP.esp active.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#c27ba0][size=3]5) Some or all outfits are not morphing to the body presets. Why?[/size][/color][/b]\n<br />\n<br />[size=3]Either you didn't select the outfit(s) when batch building in Bodyslide or the outfit has no Bodyslide support.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#c27ba0][size=3]6) Some NPCs aren't affected. What's wrong?[/size][/color][/b]\n<br />\n<br />[size=3]Some NPC replacers and followers come with their own body meshes. This means they won't be affected by OBody. A [url=https://github.com/focustense/FocusPatchers]Synthesis patcher[/url] exists to remove custom body meshes from all NPC replacers and followers. Or you can do it yourself if you know how to.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#c27ba0][size=3]7) If I remove a preset that had been assigned to an NPC will they keep it?[/size][/color][/b]\n<br />\n<br />[size=3]Yes, the preset will stay stuck to the npc until you reassign them a new preset.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#c27ba0][size=3]8) When I press O, the list is empty or the menu doesn't appear and freezes my game. Why?[/size][/color][/b]\n<br />\n<br />[size=3]This can mean several things. Only very few users are reporting this issue. Please go through these points, and remember, always test on a New Game. If it works on a New Game but not on your existing save, you might need to clean your save.\n<br />\n<br />Several users reported that using OBody with Immersive Equipment Displays causes the empty preset list bug in IED's latest version (1.6 and up). Some users reported that reverting to version [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/62001/?tab=files&amp;file_id=273745]1.5.0[/url] of IED fixes the issue.\n<br />\n<br />I can't replicate this however. IED 1.6 and OBody NG work fine for me when used together. It should still be worth trying reverting IED to 1.5.0 though...\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/5217635]slavicpotato1[/url], who is very knowledgeable in SKSE plugins and Racemenu, gave some invaluable insight regarding the empty preset list on OBody. I'll leave here quotes of some comments he left regarding the issue:\n<br />\n<br />[quote]The core issue is that racemenu registers the InterfaceExchangeMessage too early. I submitted a fix ([url=https://github.com/expired6978/SKSE64Plugins/commit/87a5cadd5c282e790ea6e9cf104bb7aa551fc4dc]https://github.com/expired6978/SKSE64Plugins/commit/87a5cadd5c282e790ea6e9cf104bb7aa551fc4dc[/url]) a long time ago, however expired only merged it recently.\n<br />\n<br />Anyone using RM prior to w/e version includes that commit will experience random failures to acquire the interface, [b]regardless of what you do with your OBody build[/b]. [b]It's not fixable on your end[/b]. The order in which plugins are loaded is non-deterministic so any change to the folder (or who knows what else) can trigger it.[/quote]\n<br />[quote]skee64 (i.e. Racemenu plugin) registered at plugin load so, due to the way skse messaging works, not all plugins *would be able to* receive the interface exchange request. Which plugins got it would depend *on the order in which the plugins were loaded* and since the order isn't guaranteed (see [url=https://github.com/ianpatt/common/blob/66149ee3e5cc783884658bc9500e944d3a61bfbe/common/IDirectoryIterator.cpp#L37]here[/url] and [url=https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-findnextfilea]here[/url]), the user basically has no control over it. Renaming might work most of the time as the order is usually alphabetical, but windows can and will decide to switch it up at some point. The options are updating, hotpatching older bins *via preloader* or users building from source, expired is not likely to backport these changes.[/quote]\n<br />\n<br />If that was too much technical jargon for you, this is what it means in very simple terms:\n<br />\n<br />It's a bug with Racemenu and due to the way SKSE and Windows handle the loading of files (this latter fact is NOT a bug). [b]So, in short, there is absolutely nothing I can do about the empty preset list on OBody's side[/b]. And since Racemenu fixes aren't backported to the earlier versions of Skyrim, the only way to avoid it is by using the latest version of Skyrim and Racemenu. Which many people are not willing to do, including myself - I am on Skyrim 1.6.353 and NEVER had the empty preset list bug.\n<br />\n<br />This potentially explains why the empty preset list gets fixed randomly for many people after saving and loading the game several times throughout their playthrough. And why it only happens to a few users randomly with no explanation. Because, really, it is an extremely random issue outside of OBody's control.\n<br />\n<br />You should still go through these points, as some of them might help fixing the bug.\n<br />\n<br />1. You have PapyrusUtil improperly installed. Please make sure that you have the correct version of PapyrusUtil for your Skyrim version:\n<br />\n<br />- For Skyrim version 1.5.97 (SE), get version 3.9.\n<br />- For Skyrim version 1.6.353 (AE), get version 4.3 under \"Old Files\".\n<br />- For Skyrim version 1.6.640 (AE), get version 4.4.\n<br />\n<br />If you have the correct version, make sure it's not being overwritten by any other mod. Some mods ship with old outdated versions of PapyrusUtil. The most popular example of such mod is Campfire. Make sure you load PapyrusUtil AFTER Campfire!!\n<br />\n<br />2. You may have a preset installed that is somehow corrupt. Remove presets until you find the culprit.\n<br />\n<br />3. You installed OBody wrongly. Go through the [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/articles/4580]installation guide[/url] again.\n<br />\n<br />4. Some users did everything correctly, got empty presets list and reported that the problem fixed itself after playing Skyrim for a while and reloading the game several times.\n<br />\n<br />5. In the SSE Engine Fixes config file (found in SKSE &gt; Plugins &gt; EngineFixes.toml, wherever you have SSE Engine Fixes installed), you can try increasing [color=#c27ba0][b]MaxStdio[/b][/color] to 4096 and 8192 and see if that fixes the problem.\n<br />\n<br />6. Try loading the [color=#c27ba0][b]OBody.esp[/b][/color] file in different places of your load order: early, in the middle or very late in the load order. Always start a new game as you change its position to test if it solves the issue.\n<br />\n<br />7. A user reported that purging [b][color=#c27ba0]OBody.esp[/color][/b] from the save in [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/5031/]Fallrim Tools[/url] fixed the problem for him. Please only do this as [b]last resort[/b].[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[img]https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/771971758047494145/1031947478343364648/Capture.JPG[/img] \n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#c27ba0][size=3]9) Everything works but the bodies don't change when I choose a preset on the OBody preset list, or the presets stop applying randomly after some time has passed, or changing the character's weight won't change the body size.[/size][/color][/b]\n<br />\n<br />[size=3]This is a memorisation issue with SSE Engine Fixes and Racemenu. The preset and weight changes will only apply if the actor redresses, if you change cells or if you save the game, exit the game and reload the game.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=3]You can also reproduce this by opening the console, type showracemenu, and try to edit the CBBE or UNP morphs. You will see that your character's body will not change.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=3]To fix this, set MemoryManager and ScaleformAllocator to false in the SSE Engine Fixes configuration found in SKSE &gt; Plugins &gt; EngineFixes.toml, wherever you installed SSE Engine Fixes to.\xa0[/size][b][u][size=4]NOTE HOWEVER that turning those two off might cause CTDs in load orders with many mods.\n<br />\n<br />[/size][/u][/b][size=3]If you get CTDs after setting those two options to false, set them back to true. You'll have to live with presets not applying right away after selecting them until either SSE Engine Fixes or Racemenu fix this issue. It is NOT a problem with OBody.\n<br />\n<br />Another thing that helps fix this problem is not running any other apps on your PC while playing Skyrim. Restarting your PC also helps. Free up that RAM, Skyrim is a RAM hungry game after all, especially when modded![/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=3]This problem also exists in Autobody, and is well documented in both Racemenu's and Autobody's Github repositories. If you don't believe me, check the Github issues below, which are still open (i.e. not fixed):\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://github.com/napmouse/autoBodyAE/issues/13]https://github.com/napmouse/autoBodyAE/issues/13[/url]\n<br />[url=https://github.com/expired6978/SKSE64Plugins/issues/51]https://github.com/expired6978/SKSE64Plugins/issues/51[/url]\n<br />\n<br />If they ever find a workaround to this, I will also implement it in OBody NG.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#c27ba0][size=3]10) I blacklisted an outfit from ORefit, but the boobs/nipples still look weird.[/size][/color][/b]\n<br />\n<br />[size=3]This is also due to the problem described in the previous question. If you change to the blacklisted outfit, remove it, and apply it again, the boobs should look normal now. Alternatively, if you apply the outfit and the boobs look weird, you can save the game, exit and restart Skyrim. When you load the save again, the boobs will look as expected.\n<br />\n<br />As I said in the previous question, this is not a bug with OBody. It's a memory issue related to Racemenu/SSE Engine Fixes and possibly how Skyrim's engine itself handles memorization.\n<br />\n<br />If after this the boobs STILL look weird, then you most likely have an outfit part equipped in a slot that is turning on ORefit (slot 32 or 46 or 56). Unequip that outfit part or also add it to the blacklist list in the JSON configuration file![/size]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#c27ba0][size=3]11) The MCM options in the OStim MCM Addons don't work![/size][/color][/b]\n<br />\n<br />[size=3]Because as I said earlier in the description, OBody NG has its own MCM if you're using the OStim version. Use the OBody NG MCM, not the one inside OStim MCM.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#c27ba0][size=3]12) Does OBody NG support OPubes and any other mod that required the original OBody?[/size][/color][/b]\n<br />\n<br />[size=3]Yes, OBody NG has full support for OPubes. Any mod that required the original OBody will be supported by OBody NG.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=3]Do note that mods like OPubes also require OStim. This means that you can't use OBody NG Standalone with OPubes. You must use OBody NG for OStim to use OPubes.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=3]Always check if a mod requiring OBody also requires OStim or not. This is not a problem with OBody. You must fulfil\xa0\x61ll of the requirements of other mods even if OBody is one of the requirements.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#c27ba0][size=3]13) The NPC bodies have purple/blue textures!![/size][/color][/b]\n<br />\n<br />[size=3]This is not a problem with OBody NG. OBody does [b][u]NOT[/u][/b] touch textures. It only morphs body meshes.\n<br />\n<br />If you are getting purple/blue body textures, it means you installed OPubes but you forgot to install one of its pube overlay packs. Go back to the [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/64151]OPubes mod page description[/url]. It is mentioned there that you must install at least one of the pube overlay packs linked in there.\n<br />\n<br />It can also mean you installed RBT and/or RSV, and did not install them properly. Once more, it's [b]not[/b] a problem with OBody NG.\n<br />\n<br />Don't come here complaining that OBody NG is giving you purple/blue bodies, because it is most certainly an installation error on your end from other mod.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#c27ba0][size=3]14) Can you add this and that feature? When will ORefit for BHUNP be ready?[/size][/color][/b]\n<br />\n<br />[size=3]Probably yes, probably not. Feel free to ask or suggest features, I will deem if I can/want to do them or not.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=3]Do not ask when they will be ready. They will be finished whenever I have the time to do so. Modding is not my job, and my personal life has priority over modding. Please respect that.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#c27ba0][size=3]15) I went through all this, I'm still having problems. Help![/size][/color][/b]\n<br />\n<br />[size=3]Providing help on the Nexus is difficult and not very efficient. For faster responses and a better troubleshooting workflow, I suggest you join the [url=https://discord.gg/Tk83wqAS]OStim Discord[/url]. I hang there often and will help you. If I'm not available, there are many others on the channel who use OBody and can help you with installation and troubleshooting problems.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[center][color=#c27ba0][size=5][b]I want to contribute to OBody NG's code[/b][/size][/color][/center]\n<br />[size=4]Please, be my guest. Me and the community will be grateful if you help fix bugs or implement new features. Here are the Github links, feel free to fork them and make PRs if you change the code. I'll review, approve and merge them to release on the Nexus.\n<br />\n<br />OBody NG (SKSE side, common code for both OStim and Standalone versions): [url=https://github.com/Aietos/OBody-NG]https://github.com/Aietos/OBody-NG[/url]\n<br />OBody NG for OStim (Papyrus side): [url=https://github.com/Aietos/OBody]https://github.com/Aietos/OBody[/url]\n<br />OBody NG Standalone (Papyrus Side): [url=https://github.com/Aietos/OBody-Standalone-NG]https://github.com/Aietos/OBody-Standalone-NG[/url][/size]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[color=#c27ba0][size=5][b][center]Mods used in screenshots[/center][/b][/size][/color]\n<br />[center][b][size=4]This mod was brought to you by [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/67966]Sswaye's Reshade. the BEST Reshade on the Nexus!\n<br />[/url]Go check it out and improve your Skyrim graphics, visuals and immersion at the cost of little to zero performance impact![/size][/b][/center]\n<br />\n<br />[center][size=4]The blonde Nord on the ORefit previews:\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/77835]Your Nord Friend's Hot Mom - Highpoly Nord Preset[/url]\n<br />\n<br />Hestla:\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/74068]BB's Dawnguard Revisited and Complete[/url]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />Ysolda:\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/71361]Dibella's Blessing - Whiterun[/url]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />Nirya:\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/43413]Northbourne NPCs of Winterhold[/url]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />Karliah:\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/36827]Pandorable's Lethal Ladies - Jenassa Karliah[/url]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />ENB:\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/39113]Rudy ENB SE for Cathedral Weathers Zangdar's Edit Lux Edition[/url]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />Female body:\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/31126]BHUNP (UUNP Next Generation) SSE[/url]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />Body and face textures:\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/65274](BnP) Female Skin[/url][/size][/center]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[center][color=#c27ba0][size=5][b]Credits[/b][/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />[size=4][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/98523348]Sairion350[/url] for creating OBody.\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/4126073?tab=user+files]SilverWolfMNG[/url] for making the amazing OBody NG logos.
