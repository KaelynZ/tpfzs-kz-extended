For truly, love is not constrained to the walls of a single temple, but must be spread and shared by all! Come, let us peruse the locations which are available to you, the most noble of practitioners, depending on what path your life takes you!\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />....and here's where I started writing out an overly-saccharine sales pitch for each of the locations using Mara's voice, but I didn't even make it halfway before I started pissing MYSELF off, so I'm sure it would have driven everyone else up the wall. So we'll skip that and just get to the nitty gritty. :D\n<br />\n<br />The Temple of Mara is nice. But we've been playing this game for WAY too long to have to go through that ceremony in the same place over and over. So I've created a mod which unlocks a variety of new locations (50, yes five-zero) where you can watch that same ceremony instead. Hooray, new scenery! In addition to this, alongside all the new locations, I've provided a patch collection for compatibility patches, and also a patching FRAMEWORK where other people can make patches to add new locations that others can download and it should \"just work.\"\n<br />\n<br />Additionally, weather should always be nice for your nuptials, and dragon spawns are turned off for the duration. Theoretically. :V\n<br />\n<br />Here's the categories and places:\n<br />\n<br />[center][img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1704/images/78127/78127-1668227667-1282289192.png[/img][/center]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Whiterun: Once Thane of Whiterun, you can have your marriage ceremony on the Dragonsreach balcony.\n<br />[/list][size=1]*Offer not valid if space currently occupied by a dragon[/size]\n<br />[list][*]Solitude: Thane of Solitude unlocks the Temple of the Divines.\n<br />[*]Windhelm: Thane of Windhelm unlocks the Temple of Talos\n<br />[*]Riften: Temple of Mara is already open to whoever, and honestly....Riften kinda sucks for scenic views, so I made a little spot outside the city alongside the lake for Thane of Riften\n<br />[*]Markarth: Thane of Markarth unlocks a bridge on Understone Keep\n<br />[*]Falkreath: Falkreath doesn't have too many scenic places unto itself, but the \"neat\" place is the graveyard, so we've added a spot there. Various city mods (or Sepolcri) make it a more interesting/scenic place.\n<br />[*]Morthal: Morthal doesn't have any particularly interesting places inside the city, but the stone circle where you can get your vamprism cured makes for a nice spot.\n<br />[/list][size=1]*Offer not valid if you or Serana are currently in the process of curing your vamprism[/size]\n<br />[list][*]Dawnstar: Dawnstar's got a neat little lighthouse that doesn't get much use. Thane of Dawnstar can have their wedding vows taken at its base. (Note: the collision is a BIT finnicky here, but it should be fixed, and also I add a lightbulb to the lighthouse because vanilla Skyrim doesn't have one? I assume various lighting mods fix it, but this might make it slightly brighter with two of 'em. Just fyi)\n<br />[*]Winterhold: Winterhold has been destroyed, so Thane of Winterhold gives a scenic view over the cliff,  looking into the world beyond and the College of Winterhold\n<br />[/list]\n<br />\n<br />Of course, our special offerings are not limited to political leaders in each hold, but perhaps you've elevated yourself to the peak of an organization. Celebrate your day in a place meaningful to your faction, that you might share these locations special to you with the one who is special to you!\n<br />\n<br />[center][img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1704/images/78127/78127-1668228005-1738949316.png[/img][/center]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]The Companions have a nice little couryard out back we can take advantage of once you've become Harbinger.\n<br />[/list][size=1]*Offer not valid if an army happens to be assaulting the city[/size]\n<br />[list][*]The courtyard of the college is honestly pretty nice and fairly under-utilized. Bench organization is done that way to dodge stuff added by other mods so various compatibility patches aren't needed. Once you're Archmage, you can get married here.\n<br />[*]Once you've completed King Olaf's Verse and have gotten accepted into the Bard's College, you can get married in the courtyard.\n<br />[*]Once you've unlocked the Blades as a faction and have reached Sky Haven Temple, you can get married in the gardens.\n<br />[*]As a reward for completing the main quest, get married on top of the world, with Partysnax in attendance. (Maybe. I don't force him to be there, but I'd assume he would be)\n<br />[*]Upon completing the Thieves Guild questline, you can get married in the Cistern. Maramal will preside, but not know where he is. (It's not necessary to have completed the Litany of Larceny or the post-TG questline quests).\n<br />[*]Upon completing the Dark Brotherhood questline, you can get married in the Dawnstar Sanctuary. Once more, Maramal will preside, but not know where he is.\n<br />[*]Complete the Dawnguard questline on the side of the Dawnguard, and you can get married atop Fort Dawnguard.\n<br />[*]Complete the Dawnguard questline on the side of the Volkihar, and you can get married in Volkihar castle. Maramal will preside, but not know where he is.\n<br />[*]If you complete the Civil War siding with the Imperials, you can get married in the spot where Vittoria Vici's wedding is. It's not as well attended or as opulent, but it's still a nice spot.\n<br />[/list][size=1]*Offer not valid if space currently occupied by Vittoria's Wedding. She's the Emperor's cousin, you know. You can't bump her priority, sorry.[/size]\n<br />[list][*]If you complete the Civil War siding with the Stormcloaks, you can get married in the Palace of the Kings.\n<br />[/list]\n<br />But not everything in Skyrim is dictated by who you know, but rather what you've done. There's MANY quests which can provide you with lovely new locations to wed.\n<br />\n<br />[center][img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1704/images/78127/78127-1668227933-1571927958.png[/img][/center]\n<br />\n<br />[list][*]Raven Rock has a temple of its own you can get married in, once you own land in Raven Rock and also have cleaned the temple of its demons.\n<br />[*]Dibella worshippers may prefer a different type of love, but they're more than open to a ceremony to Mara for the person who finds their Sybil.\n<br />[*]Eldergleam Sanctuary makes for a picturesque location, provided you don't assault the tree. Find a different way to restore the Gildergreen, and you can get married here.\n<br />[*]Azura is more than happy to let you get your blessing at the foot of her statue, provided you restore Azura's Star (and don't turn it into the Black Star).\n<br />[*]What is marriage but Sacrifice? Okay, Maramal might not be a huge fan of this one, but that's why we make sure he can't see where it's being done.\n<br />[*]Satisfy Hircine and then tie the knot where the hunt took place.\n<br />[*]Restore Malacath's blessing on the Orisimer, and get married before his statue.\n<br />[/list][size=1]Offer limited to Orcs, or people marrying Orcs. Look, man, Malacath just doesn't really give a crap about you otherwise[/size]\n<br />[list][*]Restore Mehrunes' Razor, and he's fine with you getting married outside his Shrine.\n<br />[*]Acquire Dawnbreaker and restore Meridia's Beacon's light, and get married in front of the Statue to her.\n<br />[*]Join Namira's following, and you can get married at a place that a....\"feast\" awaits you once you're done.\n<br />[/list][size=1]No, you can't eat Maramal afterwards, but if someone wants to make that patch, I'm 100% on board[/size]\n<br />[list][*]As you build your house, once you've established the main house and converted the small house to an entryway, you can get married outside your new home.\n<br />[*]As you build your house, once you've established the main house and converted the small house to an entryway, you can get married outside your new home.\n<br />[*]As you build your house, once you've established the main house and converted the small house to an entryway, you can get married outside your new home.\n<br />[*]Defeat the first Dragonborn, then piss on his grave by getting married at his temple as the Last Dragonborn\n<br />[*]Once you've defeated Arch-Curate Vyrthur, you can get married in the Inner Sanctum overlooking the Hidden Vale\n<br />[/list]\n<br />And finally, sometimes it's nice to get married a bit closer to home. These locations open up if you happen to be marrying someone from there. Not going to give real descriptions of these places, since they're....well, places, but it covers every location which has an NPC you can marry in Vanilla. They [i]should[/i] support any mods which opens up others to getting married (except Mixwater Mill - no town faction for that one, so it's keyed to the NPC name), but will obviously not include any towns which don't have people who can be married in Vanilla.\n<br />\n<br />[center][img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1704/images/78127/78127-1668227932-770145652.png[/img][/center]\n<br />[list][*]Anga's Mill\n<br />[*]Mixwater Mill\n<br />[*]Mor Khazgur\n<br />[*]Dushnikh Yal\n<br />[*]Kolskeggr Mine (Pavo's House)\n<br />[*]Soljund's Sinkhole\n<br />[*]Riverwood\n<br />[*]Kynesgrove\n<br />[*]Ivarstead\n<br />[*]Shor's Stone\n<br />[*]Karthwasten\n<br />[*]Skaal Village\n<br />[*]Darkwater Crossing\n<br />[/list]\n<br />\n<br />[center][size=6]BUT WAIT THERE'S MORE\n<br />\n<br />[img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1704/images/78127/78127-1668229055-1228219594.png[/img][/size][/center]\n<br />\n<br />In addition to all the above, the mod was set up with a framework that allows people to easily make their own patches to add new locations. More details about this, along with some examples and a complete guide as to how (and a stub patch) can be found [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/78501]on the companion page[/url]. You're limited to installing at most 10 patches per playthrough, and if you [i]ever[/i] have one installed that uses up one of the spots, even if you later remove it (protip: don't remove mods mid-save). Fair warning.\n<br />\n<br />[size=5][i]Installation[/i][/size]\n<br />Use a mod manager/organizer to install, or drop the loose files into your Skyrim data folder. This mod DOES involve persistent refs, but only placing new ones. It should theoretically work fine on an existing save....IF you haven't started the RelationshipMarriage quest (read: have EVER talked to Maramal about how marriage works in Skyrim). I won't promise it'll break things, but there's a decent amount of script/dialogue changes (for obvious reasons), so changing mid-stream when the quest is already started is not officially supported. If you've got any mod which is overwriting the scripts from this mod, it will ABSOLTELY crash and burn. Don't do that.\n<br />\n<br />[size=5][i]Compatibility[/i][/size] \n<br />- Clipping can occur with other city/interiors mods. I checked a LOT. Patches are provided for:\n<br />[spoiler][list][*]ClefJ's Winterhold - shifts the location slightly to prevent some clipping\n<br />[*]ClefJ's Dawnguard HQ - shifts the location to a new place because it was embedded in an added tower\n<br />[*] COTN Falkreath - not actually needed but it gave me a nice spot and I did it because I felt like it and the new spot is a lot better\n<br />[*] COTN Winterhold - not actually needed but it gave me a nice spot and I did it because I felt like it and the new spot is a lot better\n<br />[*] Expanded Towns and Cities - Disables some idle markers to not conflict, and minor adjustments for Riverwood, Darkwater Crossing, and Kynesgrove\n<br />[*] JK's Palace of the Kings - Disables some tables to prevent clipping, adjusts for the lowered floor\n<br />[*] JK's Sky Haven Temple - Adjusts location a lot due to conflicts\n<br />[*] JK's Skyrim - ever so slightly adjusts one bench in Riverwood, shifts the Winterhold location to prevent extremely minor clipping. If you're using one of the other Winterhold ones in a JK combo, just don't install this - the Riverwood stuff is so minimal as to be non-existent, and you'll want the other Winterhold stuff\n<br />[*] JK's Temple of Talos - CR, adjust to fit new interior\n<br />[*] Lux Via - One bridge is changed and needs some major adjustment\n<br />[*] Northern Roads - Two bridges are changed and needed some adjustment\n<br />[*] Palaces and Castles Enhanced - Exclusively for Palace of the Kings. LOTS of CR, and some minor adjustments\n<br />[*] Sky Temple Gardens - Adjustment of one bench to match new \"ground\"\n<br />[*] The Great City of Falkreath - Barely needed, but shifts location to a nicer one with new layout.\n<br />[*] The Great City of Winterhold (version 4) - Location was completely inaccessible, moved to a new location\n<br />[*] The Great Town of Ivarstead - new bridge model required adjustment\n<br />[*] The Great Town of Karthwasten - Landscape was adjusted so some tweaks were needed\n<br />[*] The Great Town of Shor's Stone - The rock formation is gone, so moved to a new location\n<br />[*] The Great Village of Kynesgrove - Honestly not really needed, but moved to a much cooler location with the addition of Kyne's Grove\n<br />[*] The Great Village of Mixwater Mill - Landscape was adjusted, so some tweaks needed.\n<br />[/list]Combo PCE-PotK patch is provided.\n<br />If using TGCWv4 and COTN's combo patch, you can use EITHER patch - your choice. Both obviously won't work.\n<br />If using TGCF/TGC/COTN combo patches, you can use EITHER patch - your choice. Both obviously won't work.\n<br />If using JK's Sky Haven Temple and Sky Temple Gardens, use the Sky Temple Gardens patch\n<br />If using ETaC and TGVoKyne, use the TGVoKyne patch\n<br />\n<br />The following were checked and DON'T need patches:\n<br />[list][*]JK's Temple of Dibella\n<br />[*]JK's Understone Keep\n<br />[*]JK's Bards College\n<br />[*]JK's College of Winterhold\n<br />[*]Immersive College of Winterhold\n<br />[*]Obscure's College of Winterhold\n<br />[*]In case it's not obvious, the fact that all three of the above work independently means that all combos work too. This was intentional and is why the benches are so weird.\n<br />[*]Greater Skaal Village\n<br />[*]Opulent Thieves Guild\n<br />[*]Enhanced Solitude\n<br />[*]The Great City of Dawnstar\n<br />[*]COTN Dawnstar\n<br />[*]ClefJ's Karthwasten\n<br />[*]Redbag's Dragonsreach\n<br />[*]The Great City of Morthal\n<br />[*]COTN Morthal\n<br />[*]GG's Thieves Guild HQ\n<br />[*]&lt;redacted&gt;\n<br />[*]Redbag's Solitude\n<br />[*]Eli's Skaal Village\n<br />[*]Bard's Reborn\n<br />[*]Immersive Fort Dawnguard\n<br />[*]Redbag's Morthal\n<br />[/list]\n<br />Anyone who asks about compatibility for any of the above will be made fun of.[/spoiler]\n<br />\n<br /> - [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/43834]I Know How Marriage Works[/url] - [color=#00ff00]Should be fine[/color]\n<br /> - [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/8589]Marriage Mod - To Have and To Hold[/url] - [color=#ff0000]Not compatible[/color]\n<br /> - Any other mod which touches any of the scripts in this mod: [color=#ff0000]Not compatible[/color]\n<br /> - [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/21625]Multiple Marriages SSE[/url]: [color=#ffff00]I have no idea[/color], it doesn't overlap the scripts, but it seems highly improbable. I'll leave it up to you guys to check.\n<br />- [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/37976]Animated Wedding Scene[/url]\xfeff - incompatible, but I plan on making a patch for...soon.ish.\n<br /> - Any mod which makes it so you can marry people: [color=#00ff00]Should be perfectly fine![/color]\n<br /> - Any mod which adds their own marriage system (see: [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/32161]Serana Dialogue Add-on[/url], [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/10238]A Serious Wedding[/url], etc) - [color=#00ff00]should be fine, but you won't get married in these spots![/color]\n<br /> - [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19638]Better Wedding Guests[/url] - haven't tested, but did dig into it a bit and looks like [color=#00ff00]it should work[/color], surprisingly enough! Give it a try, this looks cool!\n<br />- [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/66125]NPCs Wear Amuets of Mara PLUS[/url] - [color=#00ff00]Compatible with patch[/color]\n<br /> - [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/60392]Gold Sink[/url] - [color=#00ff00]guaranteed to be 100% compatible.[/color]\n<br /> - USSEP - not a hard master, but I do include all the script fixes from it. Make sure it doesn't overwrite the scripts from this one.\n<br />- I didn't bother remotely thinking about grass mods. Grass will probably be growing through some of the local spots. Either ignore it or make your own patch, I didn't want to deal with the NIGHTMARE of compatibility if I started painting landscape in every frigging town.\n<br />- Mods that add enemies may have random monsters attacking you during the ceremony. Not my fault.\n<br />\n<br />[size=5][i]FAQ[/i][/size]\n<br />[b]Wait, you only listed 48 places. Where's the other two?[/b]\n<br />- They're Easter eggs. Go romance your digital crush and see what you can find. Your only clue is that they're literally impossible to hit with Vanilla.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Will you add &lt;insert place here&gt;?[/b]\n<br />- Nope!\n<br />\n<br />[b]Why not?[/b]\n<br />- 50 is a lot already. I was actually getting close-ish to the ESL limit. But mostly because a) I don't feel like it, and b) I made it have a framework so folks can patch it themselves.\n<br />\n<br />[b]But I don't want to make the patch.[/b]\n<br />- Cool, so you understand how I feel :D Also, that's not a question. \n<br />\n<br />But really, check out the guide on the [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/78501]Add-on patch and dev kit page[/url]. It's honestly not hard, and would make for a nice \"first project\" for some folks who want to dip their toes in/learn how tools get used.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Why are we limited to 10 added location patches? That's not enough![/b]\n<br />- Stop killing your spouse. Neighbors are starting to look at you weird.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[size=5][i]Credits[/i][/size]\n<br />[url=https://bethesda.net/]Bethesda[/url]\xa0\x66or Skyrim Special Edition and the Creation Kit\n<br />ElminsterAU for\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/164]SSEEdit[/url]\n<br />JPSteel2 for the screenshots because HOLY SHIT I suck at screenshots\n<br />Jelidity for reining in my bad instincts with her suggestions\n<br />TwistedModding for being the weirdo who volunteered to test that...you know...actually did some testing\n<br />A bunch of people in various discords for putting up with me talking/posting about this thing as I made it."
