An exemplary hero, or a sly slaver.\n<br />Every decision counts. Some consequences may surprise you, so be prepared.\n<br />\n<br />Meet a strange girl, try to get to know her better. Or not.\n<br />You should know that she's quite a character, with her own opinions. And she will get to know you, step by step.\n<br />Just don't forget - she's a Khajiit, and some racial stereotypes are true.\n<br />\n<br />[line]\n<br />[b][color=yellow][size=4]{[u]What will you get?[/u]}[/size][/color][/b]\n<br />\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*] A long and dark story, with about 8 hours of gameplay for each ending.\n<br />[*] 7 main quests and 1 optional.\n<br />[*] 3 true endings, and several minor ones.\n<br />[*] Dialogue options to choose from in almost every conversation, which will affect the ending - among them a few unique options, available based on player's race, skills, etc.\n<br />[*] Full voice acting for every new NPC. What's more, 2 voice types to choose between for the main character.\n<br />[*] Several new locations and items.\n<br />[*] Knowledge of some Khajiiti customs.\n<br />[*] A maid for your house, who will cook for you and teach you a few thief-oriented skills.\n<br />[*] Collectable hand-drawn sketches.\n<br />[*]And last but not least - a unique follower.\n<br />[/list]\n<br />Don't ask why she looks like this, it's explained in the mod. Play it and you can find out.\n<br />\n<br />[b]As a follower, she:[/b]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*] will reply differently depending on relationship status and endings.\n<br />[*] likes to comment on what's around her - places, people, and on you as well (you can change how often she comments by giving her special potions - at some point in the story the trader added by this mod starts selling them).\n<br />[*] knows several songs and likes to sing if asked nicely.\n<br />[*] has a satchel (and will use items placed in it), and a backpack (which is a safe storage she won't touch).\n<br />[*] will not conflict with vanilla quests and mods that alter followers, because she uses a separate, custom system made just for her.\n<br />[*] will ride a tiger mount (unlockable at some point of the \"good\" routes).\n<br />[*]can be teleported to the player almost anytime (this also needs to be unlocked).\n<br />[*] does not affect follower count.\n<br />[*] remembers where to live if dismissed (you have to tell her the location first, but it doesn't have to be a player-owned house!)\n<br />[*] wears several outfits - some she gets as the story progresses, others you can make, others she can find somewhere and... borrow.\n<br />[*] can be told to wear a specific armor if you gained her trust (or her obedience).\n<br />[*] will learn new tricks to use in combat - if you teach her, that is; will you?\n<br />[*] moves around interacting with everything if she's bored by the player standing still.\n<br />[*] can be silenced via a special item if you're tired of her voice.\n<br />[*] won't set off traps.\n<br />[*] will not kill you or your other followers in case of friendly fire.\n<br />[*] is mortal, but can be made unkillable using an item (you can get one after every true ending).\n<br />[*]has a few face and body variants to choose from (as installation options).\n<br />[*]loves Moon Sugar!\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[line]\n<br />[b][color=yellow][size=4]{[u]Got stuck? Have a question?[/u]}[/size][/color][/b]\n<br />\n<br />Read the FAQ in the Articles section.\n<br />There is also a comprehensive guide with a walkthrough (if you don't fear spoilers...)\n<br />It's highly recommended to check the FAQ before asking questions.\n<br />\n<br />[line]\n<br />[b][color=yellow][size=4]{[u]Requirements[/u]}[/size][/color][/b]\n<br />\n<br />This mod only requires the official DLCs:\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*] Dawnguard\n<br />[*] Dragonborn\n<br />[/list]\n<br />No other mods nor SKSE are needed, this mod is completely standalone.\n<br />\n<br />[line]\n<br />[b][color=yellow][size=4]{[u]Installation[/u]}[/size][/color][/b]\n<br />\n<br />I recommend to use a mod manager - this will give you access to the installer that will show you descriptions and screenshots, and install the right files for you based on your choices.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]Manual installation[/b] (if for some reason you can't use a mod manager):\n<br />Extract the following folders from the mod archive into your Skyrim/Data:\n<br />\n<br />[i][u]Required files[/u][/i]\n<br />00 Core&#92;\xa0\xa0 \x2190 this includes all her default textures, UNP body and voice files by Sininensusi\n<br />04 Faces&#92;Main&#92;\xa0\xa0 \x2190 this is required if you don't choose one of the non-default face variants described below)\n<br />\n<br />[i][u]Voice files[/u] - optional[/i]\n<br />07 Voices&#92;Adlora&#92;
