WARNING AND DISCLAIMER(?): This mod contains harsh language and jokes! Brhuce
is not a nice dunmer, and will take every opportunity to belittle you,
everything around you, and everything else. If you are the kind of
person who is easily offended, or a wuss, do not download this mod, or
if you do, do not complain to us if your feelings are hurt afterwards.
You have been warned!

So, you've scoured the internet, you've seen all the follower mods there are to see, and gosh darnit to jeez christ gosh heck, you're sick of all the glassy-eyed waifus, the big-foreheaded floozies, and the barely-dressed barbies that look like they were designed by a middle-schooler who just discovered the opposite gender. You want a better companion, a trustworthy companion. You want a follower who exudes quality. You want a follower who stands for excellence, integrity, and lore-friendliness.
Until such a follower exists, why not try out Brhuce Hammar. He throws trains at people!

Brhuce Hammar: Legacy, is a fully-voiced, standalone quest and companion mod centered around the titular character Brhuce Hammar. An unhinged and disgraced Telvanni magelord, Brhuce Hammar is a snarky, old, and powerful wizard with an unhealthy obsession with machines. Recently arrived in Skyrim, Brhuce and the Dragonborn encounter one another, and forge a friendship that will stand the test of time. And by this, I mean Brhuce thinks you're a useful idiot. As the player will soon find, Brhuce's life is nothing like anything they've encountered before, and the player will often be dragged along by Brhuce on his various schemes and adventures.
You, the player, will find themselves traversing planes of Oblivion, fighting off invasions of otherwordly beings, blasting off to space and exploring the secrets of the Dwemer, and even piloting your own giant robot. I'm not kidding, we added a giant robot into the game, and you get to drive it and use it to fight giant monsters.
Really.
You'll also find yourself gaining a vast arsenal of new rewards, artifacts, spells, and weapons! Drink from the fabled Tankard of Why, shoot Daedrons from your mouth, convert gems to gem ingredients, and even get your own robotic horse to ride around in!
Brhuce himself of course, has various commentary, quips, and jokes, all fully voiced. In addition to passive random comments, you can sometimes ask Brhuce his opinion on something, and recieve a variety of observations. Brhuce is also able to be married, has his own mount, spells, and much much more!

+Custom armor, weapons, and even spells! Watch as Brhuce chucks trains at people, vomits steam, or rams them with the full force of his raillroady might.
+Able to be married by any gender, if a nerdy 300 year old technomancer interests you like that.

+His own very special mount, which he will ride on whenever you yourself mount a horse! No other mods required!

+The ability to convert items into other items! He can also give you other items! Yaaaaay items!

-Five huge quests offered by Brhuce, that will take you through the planes of Oblivion (including Quagmire!), let you explore a Dwemer space station in zero-g, raid the ruins of a Daedric prince, fend off an alien invasion, and even pilot your own giant robot!
-Tons of new locations, new Oblivion realms, the Lost Dwemer Station of Khagrenzell, to the ancient Zhatterdhome, and even Sanguine's secret lair of... things.
-The ability to pilot your own giant robot! That's right, you and Brhuce may climb aboard your own mech, and pilot it against kaiju, defending Skyrim from various foes, and claim rewards for doing so!
-New enemies, from the deadly Brhucebot, the fit Swole Troll, to the mysterious Salmon of Doubt.
-New armors, weapons, and spells all available through the quests. New artifacts, spells that can be used underwater, and I think we already mentioned the robot horse, but you get one.
