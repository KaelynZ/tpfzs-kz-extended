Kaelyn's extensions of TPFZS - The Phoenix Flavor - Zediious Sprinkles

This repository is a record of my current Skyrim SE build, which is based on The Phoenix Flavor - Zediious Spinkles (aka TPFZS) build from Wabbajack.  I am adding numerous mods that Zediious does not plan to add to TPFZS, such as numerous followers, all Creation Club content, The Legacy of the Dragonborn, and adult content including Flower Girls and OStim NG.  Given that I am modifying TPFZS so heavily, my modlist can be regarded as a fork of TPFZS.  While I plan to integrate future revisions to TPFZS into my build, this is not a firm commitment.

While this repository is public, it is not designed for general public consumption.  It is not a guide or modlist anyone else to use.  However, it is a repository of patch files and eslified mods that I have created, which other people are free to use.

The core file in this repository is the Changelog, which is an annotated log of all the modifications I have made, such installing new mods (including source URL, which files I downloaded, and notes), mods I have edited (especially eslifying) or removed, and patches I have created.  It exists mostly so I have a record of what I've done and why I did it, but experienced modders may find it educational.  If you search for specific mods by name, you can learn where I got them from, issues I may have encountered with them, and reasons why I may have chosen to install or uninstall them.

At the time this modlist was started, the rig I was using was pretty much a potato, being a AMD 4600G cpu with integrated graphics, and no dedicated graphics card.  In order to get anything close to 30 FPS, I had to disable ENB and DynDOLOD.   Thus, this modlist is very much focussed on gameplay, not graphics.  However, after I  upgrade my rig with a proper GPU, I will be looking at improving the graphics, too.
