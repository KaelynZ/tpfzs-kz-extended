Disabled:	DXMCO - Creeatures
	My dog companion wasnt animating when he walked, just gliding as a statue.  Disabling DXMCO - Creatures fixes problem

Disabled:		Root Builder
	Moved to a StockGame installation of SSE, kept within the base TPFZS MO2 folder.
	Due to my MO2 crashing a lot on installing/removing mods, RB kept messing up, copying things to overwrite, hanging, etc.
	Plus, there was always a 5 second delay starting or exiting the game.
	So, for stability and speed, moved to a TPFDE-like 'StockGame' installation.
	Create a 'StockGame' folder in the TPFZS main MO folder.
	Fill it with a 1.5.97 game, including data, esms, bsas, and ESPECIALLY CC content.
	Look at the 'Data/Root' folder inside MO right hand Data pane, and copy all files listed to the new StockGame folder
	Edit all the MO executables (or create new ones) to point to new location in StockGame.
	Nemesis needs a new ini, either reinstall or copy existing ini to a new mod folder.
	Change Nemesis_Engine\nemesis.ini :  SkyrimDataDirectory=auto
	Nemesis will update that to the new location after first run.
	Add to SSEdit executable command line: -D:"<TPFDX folder>\\StockGame\\data"

	v1.0.13
	Mod Order: N/A
	Notes: Add NFF Ignore Tokens to custom followers that use their own AI (just another Quality of Life minifix)
		This mod aims to supply with a vetted SPID distribution-list for followermods and/or NPCs that are NOT to be imported into NFF.  Blocking is done by means of using SPID to distribute the 'NFF Ignore Token' into the respective followers inventory, basically stopping the player from importing it into the NFF framework (at least not without explicitly cleaning the follower inventory first).
		Handles all the cool follower mods, practically a list of the best ones around.

ESLify:
	Lilly - A fully-voiced female courier replacer and follower
	Notes:  only do this AFTER installing Appearance Replacer
	Procedure: 
		Highly recommend installing ESLifyEverything in MO2 folder, because you will need a different setup for each MO2 installation.
		In MO2, create an empty mod named 'ESLifyEverything Output'.  Enable it.
		In MO2 Excutables menu, add ESLifyEverything.  Check 'Create files in mod' option, point to 'ESLifyEverything Output'
		Edit ESLifyEverything/AppSettings.json.  Update file paths to correct locations.  My version looks like:
			"XEditFolderPath": "c:\\Portable Apps\\xEdit",
			"DataFolderPath": "C:\\TPFZS\\Stock Game\\Data",
			"OutputFolder": "c:\\TPFZS\\mods\\ESLifyEverything Output",
			"MO2": {
				"MO2Support": true,
				"OutputPluginsToSeperateFolders": true,
				"MO2ModFolder": "c:\\TPFZS\\mods"
			}
			
		Start SSEEdit on Seraphim - PrettyCourier.esp and Lilly Replacer Default Equipment.esp
		On Seraphim - Pretty Courier.esp, Compact FormIDs for ESL, then set ESL flag in File Header.
		Exit SSEEdit, saving both altered esps
		Run ESLifyEverything.exe.  This is most easily done from MO2, but can also be done externally.  It does not use MO's virtual file system.

MOD EDIT:
	Even Better Quest Objectives
	Goal: Put scripts in a BSA.   Use BSArchPro.exe from https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/63243.  Hide loose scripts.
	Why:  EBQO scripts must override those in USSEP, but I want the overridden my scripts in other mods, such as Alternative College Entry.  Unfortunately, scripts in ACE are in a BSA file, while the EBQO scripts are loose, which means they will *always* override the ACE versions.  Rather than unpacking the ACE scripts, the proper thing to do is put the EBQO scripts into a BSA, which is how the mod should have been packaged in the first place.
	This means that if EBQO gets reinstalled, this BSA packing will have to be done again.

	https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/86848?tab=files
	Download: Clouds AIO 1.4
	Notes: No performance impact (winterhold is the heaviest).  Lod friendly.  Clouds are full lod - you do not need to generate or re-generate lod for this. You do not need to disable this mod to generate lod with dyndolod. They are visible from very far away.  Load order - Fully compatible. Use with any weather mod. Place this above water mods. Or you get water seams. Nothing else needs to be done. If in doubt, place this high (low priority) in your load order in regards with other mods that edit worldspaces. This is highly compatible, and I could not find anything else besides whats in the misc files.

	Meet Caesia, the cocky and mysterious mage. She will accompany you in your adventure and use her witty dialogue to entertain you. Discover her story as you progress your relationship with her.
	DL: v2.0b
	LOOT: with other followers
	Notes: This mod can be seen as an immensely simplified version of Shezarrine: The Fate Of Tamriel﻿ (which, I desperate need level designers, scripters, and modelers, please help if you have the time). Caesia herself, however, is mutually exclusive with that mod, though theoretically they can be installed and used together, their stories are incompatible.  Fount in Morthal inn.

	Caesia Slightly Enhanced 1.1

	https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/5941
	Provides adult themed content for the dragonborn. In a world beset by violence, Flower Girls aims to share love. It can be considered an all-in-one solution for those looking for both lighthearted entertainment, or the immersion of giving your character an active love life.
	Notes:  This mod is REQUIRED for much adult content.  Adult mods generally uses either Flower Girls, OStim, or Sexlab for their adult animations; many mods have patches allowing you to choose which of those three frameworks the mod will use.  Any or all of those three frameworks can be installed simultaneously, though any given mod will use only one.   Flower Girls is the simplest and least customizable of those animation frameworks.
	DL: FlowerGirls SE and VR Main File 3.0.2
	LOOT: esm file, will autosort with other esms
	
	Seductress Faye - Custom voiced FG Follower 1.7

INSTALL NOTES:
	My modlist has now reached its ESP limit, with the highest esp being at index FC.  In order to add more mods, we must disable, merge, or elsify existing mods.

ESLIFY:
	DBVO_Base.esp  - use Wrye Bash to set ESL Flag.  No editing or compaction needed.

ESLIFY:
	Alchemists Vestments.esp
	mod: Alchemists Vestments - CBBE Refit
	- can use xEdit to compact FormIDs, then set ESL flag in file header.  This mod has only textures and meshes, no scripts, voices, or faces.  In my load order, it has no dependencies (check with Wrye Bash, right click on esp, List Dependencies), so it does not need to be loaded with anything else in xEdit before eslifying.  *DO NOT* edit the existing esp in place; create a copy of the mod (or at least the esp) in another folder in MO2's mods folder, enable it, then edit the copy.  Note than in default TPFZS load order, the correct Alchemists Vestments.esp to edit is in the mod The Alchemist's Vestments - CBBE Refit.

ESLIFY
	NoRoadPredatorsRedone.esp
	mod: No Road Predators Redone
	-- esp-only mod, no dependents in my load order.  Copy mod, then compact formIDs and set ESL flag in xEdit new esp

ESLIFY
	NoGrassINCaves.esp
	mod: No Grass in Caves
	-- esp-only mod, no dependents in my load order.  Copy mod, then compact formIDs and set ESL flag in xEdit new esp

	Super Simple Lock Bash.esp
	mod: Super Simple Lock Bash
	-- mod has scripts in bsa, but scripts do not refer to any specific formIDs.  No other assets.  No dependents in my load order.   Copy esp into new mod, then compact formIDs and set ESL flag in xEdit new esp
	
ESLIFY
	suspiciouscityguards.esp
	mod: Suspicious City Guards
	-- mod has scripts in bsa, but scripts do not refer to any specific formIDs.  No other assets.  No dependents in my load order.   Copy esp into new mod, then compact formIDs and set ESL flag in xEdit new esp

ESLIFY
	saddlebags.esp
	mod: Iron Dusk's Laboratory - Saddlebags
	-- mod has scripts in bsa, but scripts do not refer to any specific formIDs.  No other assets.  No dependents in my load order.   Copy esp into new mod, then compact formIDs and set ESL flag in xEdit new esp
	--- note that this mod is for oldrim, Skyrim LE
	--- fix esp by loading into Creation Kit, then re-saving.  will change to a form 44 esp

ESLIFY
	MaiqAnniversaryEdition.esp
	mod: M'aiq The Liar Modders Edition
	-- mod has voice files, no other assets.  No dependents in my load order.  No cells created.  Copy esp into new mod.  Activate new mod, disable original mod.  Open xEdit, select only your new mod.  Use the CTRL + ALT + E shortcut or the "Apply Script" command and select "__ESPFEFollower﻿" script (from ESPFE Follower - Eslify facegen and voices https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/56396 - read the instructions).  This script will compact the formIDs, set the ESL flag, and rename the voice files.  Copy new files from wherever xEdit put them (overwrite by default, or specified output directory in MO2 executable tab) into your new mod.  Don't worry about removing old fuz files - they won't hurt anything.
	
TESTING:
	My last mod index is now F4, meaning I now have 9 free esp slots.  I could do more, except that the other mods I could eslify either have dependents (many just ZedPatch) or more complex assets.  Time to test.  Must start new game, cannot load old game with eslified esps, that's a sure path to countless problems.  Delete old saves first, for safety.  Run Nemesis.  Start game.

INSTALL:

	DL: (4) Community Overlays 2 - Main - CBBE and Male 1.0
	DNI: esp file, needs to be eslified
	
DISABLE:
	Sofia Follower - Alternate Spawn for Compatibility
	Reason:  Don't like the location, inside the stable with (in my load order) a horse.  Makes first conversation bad, with a horse in the way.  Only reason to move her is that ICAIO spawns a table right on top of her, which looks stupid.  Better solution is to disable table spawn once ICAIO is installed.
	
TODO:
REINSTALL:
	Saints and Seducers Extended Cut

GAMEPLAY NOTES:
	2023-05-03  12:43pm
	Started new game.
	Issue: MCM recorder script could not find an option for EVG conditional Idles - Shield Cover
	Issue: Hands of character are blue/purple, indicating missing texture.
	try: Rebuilt 3BBB 3BA body parts in BodySlide
	Result:  fixed hands!
	Issue: my high elf companion is not in riverwood inn at startup.  Recorder is, though.  And Gorr.  No wenches, either.
	No Alternate Conversation Camera in MCM
	CTD on save while in Rigmor quest
	edited Alternate Conversation Camera ini, always go to 1st person

INSTALL:
	Improved Alternate Conversation Camera 1.2.0
	https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/68210
	Improved version of Alternate Conversation Camera by NasGorTelorCeplok with MCM, fixes and more.
	DL: Improved Alternate Conversation Camera SE v1.2.0
	LOOT: anywhere
	Notes:  This totally replaces the dll used by Alternate Conversation Camera, which does not have an esp, so it is totally drop-in compatible.  It uses the same ini file as ACC, so if you have a personalized ACC ini file, copy that file into a new mod that loads later than ImprovedACC.

DISABLE:
	Alternate Conversation Camera
	Reason:  now using Improved Alternate Conversation Camera
	Notes:  Do not remove mod, just uninstall in in your profile, as vanilla TPFZS uses it
	
GAMEPLAY:
	CTD in Rigmor quest, after delivering her to camp - CTD on entering boat (fast travel) to return to standing stones.
	This did *not* occur on my last playthrough.  Time to hit xEdit.

	https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/89676?tab=files
	Notes: ESL-flagged. Safe to install midgame. Place AFTER Taunt your Enemies (both for the esp and files).

ON THE RADAR:
	Remiel Refined - COtR - ESL Flagged
	https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/90614
	Remiel NPC Overhaul changes Remiel's appearance and you can optionally change her armor to HDT-SMP Melony Armor (by Fuse00).
	Note: This mod does not require COtR or CBBE! This mod overhauls Remiel using COtR and CBBE body texture. You can also optionally give HDT-SMP Melony Armor (by Fuse). You don't need to have COTR and CBBE installed because everything is already included in this mod. Also, COtR uses its own face textures for males and this means that there always be a slight neck seam or a bit unnatural transition between the neck and the body.
	DO NOT INSTALL YET.  Want to see original Remiel before I start editing her.  This one is really cute, though - I'm a sucker for big round glasses.
	
ON THE RADAR:
	HDT-SMP Melony Armor
	https://www.patreon.com/posts/hdt-smp-melony-67711235
	HDT-SMP light armor for female CBBE/UNP (also compatible with other CBBE/UNP variations like CBBE 3BA/BHUNP (since they share the same textures)).
	Notes: Physics is enabled for belt props and body (breasts/buttocks). Includes: Body armor; Gauntlets; Boots; Faster HDT-SMP plugin is required to run the physics. The armor can be crafted on forge and tempered on workbench, or type "help melony" in the console to find related ARMO ID and spawn an item with "player.additem <ID> 1" command, or use mods like QUI or AddItemMenu.
	DO NOT INSTALL YET.  HDT-SMP Physics is not yet installed.

	Kaidan 2 - Autumnwatch Lodge and Dwarven Mail CC Patch
	https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/64822
	A small patch for Kaidan 2's Autumnwatch Lodge player home and the Alternative Armors - Dwarven Mail Creation Club.
	DL: main v1.1 23 mar 2022
	Notes: Kaidan's home overwrites and removes a unmarked campsite used by CC.  This mod removes those edits, re-enabling the vanilla campsite.
	LOOT: shortly after 0Kaidan.esp

	Immersive Kaidan Start
	https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/64064
	Kaidan 2 is a popular follower mod, but it always bugged me that you are given a quest to find him from the start of the game. This patch removes the objective to find him on the start of the game, and instead adds a few ways to find him in game in a more immersive way.
	DL: main v 2.1.1 19 apr 2022

	Fix the T pose of the bone colossus skeleton from the creation club content "Necromantic Grimoire".
	DL: main v1.0 06 feb 2022
	Notes: Somehow the mod hdt-smp/ faster hdt-smp messed up the skeleton of the lurkers from the dragonborn dlc and caused them to keep having the infamous T-pose glitch. XPMSSE fixed the issue but the fix was not applied to the bone colossus added by cc, which used the skeleton of the lurkers. This mod simply replaces the bone colossus skeleton with the fixed lurker skeleton.
	
	(CC Fishing) Rubbish Retrieval Bugfix
	https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/77453
	Rubbish Retrieval radiant quest was supossed to send you to either Markarth, Riften, Dawnstar or Morthal. However, due to an implementation bug, the possibilities of being sent to Dawnstar or Morthal are very slim. Rejoice yourself, because with this mod you will be able to experience this epic quest as it was originally intended.

	Orcish Orc Strongholds - Creation Club Orcish Armors Integrated

	Integrated Orcish Plate and Orcish Scaled from Creation Club by giving members of Orc Strongholds the appropriate equipment.
	DL: Orcish Orc Strongholds 1.0a 29 apr 2022
	Notes: The reasoning behind giving the armors to these specific NPCs was simply based on their vanilla equipment: whoever equipped vanilla Scaled set will receive the equivalent Orcish Scaled parts, and Orcish Plate for Steel. Currently, this integration only affects Orc Strongholds most, hence its name. I've no plan to integrate it to leveled list as it would be covered by Creation Club Integration - Armours

	An all-encompassing integration and distribution mod that includes modules for a wide array of different content.
	DL: main v1.3.3 27 mar 2023
	LOOT: For the best results load Tamrielic Distribution.esp and all its plugins as low in your load order as possible.
		Tamrielic Distribution - Lucien.esp  immediately after Lucien.esp
		Tamrielic Distribution - Moon Monk Robes and Lunar Guard Armor.esp  immediately after Kad_MoonMonkRobes.esp
		Tamrielic Distribution - Unique Stros M'Kai Rum.esp immediately after StrosMKaiRum.esp
		Tamrielic Distribution - Save the Icerunner Patch.esp immediately after SaveTheIcerunner.esp
	FOMOD: what it auto-selects.
	Notes:There are a handful of mods I recommend you pair with Tamrielic Distribution to further integrate content into your game. While this mod has a few modules for Alternative Armor content it doesn't actually add the armors into loot lists. I recommend you use On a Crimson Trail for this. Not only does it cleanly and naturally add all these armors to vanilla loot lists but it also overhauls the quests to feel more natural and interconnected. I provide optional plugins to disable the Alternative Armor quests for all the content not currently covered by Crimson Trail. If you use the Crossbow Collection Module it is recommended that you pair it with Thwack. I also recommend you pick up Kachuck to completely integrate Anniversary Edition's crossbows.

	YES!!!! I'm in!  And its so late i need to crash.  Tomorrow...
	
==========
2023-05-06
==========

NEW RELEASE:
	TPFZS 0.9.4
	released today, numerous changes.
	Use Wabbajck to find The Phoenix Flavor Zediious Sprinkles
	Recommend:  BACKUP existing Wabbjack\downloaded_mod_lists\Zediious_@@_thephoenixflavor_zedsprinkles.wabbajack files before downloading new version.
	
	Download new wabbackajack file.
	Run new wabbajack file.
	Set Downloads folder to wherevere yove already put stuff (C:\SSE Downloads on my rig)
	Set Output folder to a new folder (C:\TPFZS094 on my rig)
	Installed in new c:\TPFZS094 folder, which is reference that will be used in later steps.
	CLEAN your existing Steam Skyrim SE install (C:\Steam\steamapps\common\Skyrim Special Edition on my rig).  I mean, clean - straight from factory version, no extraneous dlls or xEdit or anything new in Data.  If need be, rename your existing SSE folder to SSE.old or something, then download a new copy using Steam using 'check files integrity option').  If you installed a new version, make sure you run it alt least once, to get the ini files set up.
	Run your new TPFZS 0.9.4 game.  Start up c:\TPFSZ094\Mod Organizer.exe.  Insure the big button up right refers to SKSE, no a purge or some other tool.  Click it.
	Have fun playing your new TPFZE 0.9.4!
	
	Now, it's time to get to work.  We're going to merge TPFZS 0.9.4 into the existing (highly modified) TPFZS 0.9.3.5, MO folder, while keeping working profile for th eold version, the old modified version, the new TPFZS 0.9.4 version, and 0.9.4 with all my new mods added.
	
	This will require about 300 GB of free space on your disk.
	

FIND DIFFERENCES:
	Tool:  Meld 3.22.0
	https://meld.app/
	Procedure:
		Preferences menu (3 bars in upper right header):
			Folder Comparisons:
				UNCHECK Apply text filters during folder comparisons
			File Filters:
				add new category 'MO Metadata', pattern 'meta.ini'.
				CHECK Media
				CHECK MO Metadata
		File Filters:  (button in Upper right header)
			UNCHECK Same
			CHECK New				(was UNCHECK, that is an error)
			CHECK Modified
			CHECK Backups
			CHECK OS-Specific Metadata
			CHECK Version Control
			CHECK Modified
			CHECK Binaries
			CHECK Media
			CHECK Mo Metadata
			UNCHECK Ignore filename case
			UNCHECK Normalize Unicode paths
			
	Compare Folders:
		mods/ folder in old installation (C:\TPFZ\mods, on my rig)
		mods/ folder in new installation (C:\TPFZ094\mods, on my rig)
		
	- Produces a list of mods that contain different files between the two versions.  Should be only a few dozen.  Right click and collapse all folders, the open mods/, to see just the mods that are different, as opposed to filly expanded version showing the files.

RENAME MODS:
	- Now go into the new mods/ folder (C:\TPFSZ094\mods) and Rename all mods listed in the new mods folder that are different from their old version.   I added a version number and the string 'TPFZ094'.  E.g.  if mod 'foobar' is listed as changed, and MO says the new version is x.y, rename C:\TPFZS094\mods\foobar to 'foobar x.y TPFZS094'.  This will clearly label it by version number, and indicate that it came from the TPFZS 0.9.4 build.
	
	- Now re-run the comparison in Meld.  It should now list zero differences, as you have renamed all the folders with changes, so they now coult as 'new' folders rather than 'modified' ones.  If not zero, go and finish renaming all the TPFZS094 mods that are still showing up.
	
	- Now the TPFZ094/mods folder only contains two sorts of mods:
		1. those that are identical to their old versions (the majority, though technically their metadata differs), and
		2. new folders that have no equivalent name in the old install, either because they're new to 0.9.4, or because we just renamed them.

BACKUP:
	BACKUP the existing TPFZS mods/ folder, by creating a copy of it (I named mine 'mods 0.9.3.5 backup').  This will be a big folder; make sure you have enough disk space. (mine was 226.1 GB, and took over 15 minutes to back up).  We can eventually remove theis backup, but only after we're certain everything is working.

CHECK FREE SPACE:
	Make sure you have enough disk space, at least 190 GB free.  While we dont technically need enough for the entire mods/ folder, as most of it wont't get copied, Explorer wont do the copy if there's not enough space.

	If you don't have enought space, the next step can be a MOVE rather a COPY, but that's riskier  If you have time, compress the backup copy of mods/ that you just made.  This will take a long while, nearly 2.5 hours on my SSD - go get lunch or something - but will compress 225 GB down to about 80, freeing up 150 GB.  However, it would be faster have have Wabbajack re-install the files you moved rather than do a compression.
	

COPY (or MOVE) NEW mods from 0.9.4 into existing MO folders:
	COPY TPFZS094\mods folder to TPFZS, or MOVE if lacking enough free space.
	This will result in overwrite warnings.  DO NOT replace/overwrite anything.  CHECK 'Do this for all future conflicts button'.  Wait.
	
OVERLOOKED FLAW:
	The comparison I did omitted new files - so it overlooked those mods that changed by adding new files, or by hiding files, or moving esps to the optional/ folder.  These are real version changes that need to be handled by creating new mods, but at least no files got overwritten: the existing mods should still work just fine in existing profiles, though they need new versions to work with 0.9.4.  Fortunately, there aren't many.
	
	Future Note:  Show 'New' files in Meld comparison, and rename mods with new files, too.
	
COPY PROFILE:
	Create a copy of the 'Refined' profile in TPFZS 0.9.4(and any new ones you've created), in C:\TPSFS\profiles
	Rename to copy to 'Refined 0.9.4'.
	Move that new profile (and any others you may have created) to C:\TPFZS\profiles.

FIXING MY ERROR:
	Start Wabbajack
	click on middle button, Intall Downloaded
	Should still be pointing to new TPFZS version.
	Select same folders as used before:  C:\TPFZS094 and C:\SSE Downloads, for me
	UNCHECK 'Overwrite Installation'.  We just want to update it, not throw it away and start over.  At least, st this point.
	Click the bug green start arrow.
	Enjoy the slide slow as it checks to see whats already there and downloads what's not, same as an interupted install.
	It should only need to re-install about a dozen mods, less than 30 GB.  But one of those mods is DynDOLOD output, which is huge.
	Close when done.
	Boot up 0.9.4 to make sure it's ok.

LOOK FOR MODS WITH NEW CONTENT:
	Boot up Meld.  Same folders as before, will be in list of saved comparisons.
	File Filters:  (button in Upper right header)
			UNCHECK Same
			CHECK New				(was UNCHECK, that is an error)
			UNCHECK Modified		( we dont want to see the ones we renamed and copied before)
	Now look at the right pane (TPFZS094).  Ignore crossed out mods.
	Of the mods NOT crossed out, look over in the right pane, and see if there is already a TPFZS094 flagged version in TPFSZ.
	Ignore those.
	For the mods that do NOT have a TPFZS094 variant yet, open the TPFZS094 Mod Organizer, and rename them.  There should only be a handful.
	I found:
		Misc. College of Winterhold Tweaks
		SkySight Male Skin
		Tactical Valtheim
	Rename them all in MO by adding a version numver and 'TPFZS094'
	COPY the newly renamed mods over to TPFZS/mods.
	Close TPFZS094 MO2.

Update the Refine 0.9.4 Profile in old MO
	Open the old MO, the one for TPFZS 0.9.3.5
	It should have at least one new profile, Refined 0.9.4.
	Switch to profile Refined 0.9.4
	You should see what looks like a perfectly good profile, with lots and lots of mods (everything 0.9.4 doesnt use) unchecked at the end.
	In the left pane filter box, enter 'TPFZS094'.
	At the bottom, you should see the three new mods you added, unchecked.
	Check them.
	Clear the filter box.  Filter on <Active> mods.
	For each of the 3 new mods you just added, move the mod to just after the mod with the same name that des not have the 'TPFZ094' tag, and uncheck the version that does not have the TPFZ094 tag

ACTIVATE CC CONTENT IF NECCESSARY
	If you have replaced the fake CC content used by TPFZS with the real stuff (as I did), then you need another step.
	In the right pane, Plugins tab, sort by flags, click again if need be to get the paperclips up top.
	You may see a couple of red triangles.  In my case, ZedPatch2 and HFE-CC Fishing Patch were both missing CC Fish (ccBGSSSE001-Fish.esm) as a master.
	Find it in your Plugins list, and check it to activate it.
	
TEST
	Keep the new Refined 0.9.4 profile active.
	Start SKSE.
	With any luck, the game should start with all the new mods, no problem.
	Note:  if you have disabled Root Loader and are using a private version of Skyrim SE (as I did), this game will be using the ENB (or lack thereof) of your existing setup, not that of 0.9.4.

IT LIVES!!!
	Victory!  0.9.4 is now working in my old 0.9.3.5 MO, in a profile that has only the 0.9.4 stuff activated, with all the old stuff and all my new mods deactivated.  Continuing testing.

OKAY, NOW WHAT?

CREATE NEW PROFILES
	Copy the Refined 0.9.4 profile to a new MO profile named KZ 0.9.4
	KZ 0.9.4 will be the profile we will be working with now.
	The old KZ profile (which worked) is now frozen, and not to be edited in the course of normal events.
	Also copy the Refined 0.9.4 profile to tow other new profiles - Refined 0.9.4 Original, and Refined 0.9.4 Experimental.
	The Refined 0.9.4 Original profile is a backup that will never be touched.
	The Refined 0.9.4 Experimental profile is the one we're gonna use for experiments.

FIX THE MOD LIST for KZ 0.9.4
	This was a complex task requiring clever use of Meld to compare the old KZ profile to the new one, and insert old stuff where appropriate.
	Not easily explained.
	It worked, and I have a working load order.
	
FIX THE LOAD ORDER
	This is trickier.  MO does not like anyone editing load orders except itself or a tool; I can't easily do it using Meld, at least not while MO is running.
	Given that the load order from KZ is *mostly* correct - while new versions of mods were installed, they tended to use the same esps, it will be easiest to start with the KZ load order.
	Procedure:
		1. In MO right pane, create a backup the the current (KZ 0.9.4) load order, using the 'Create a Backup' button.
		2. Close MO
		3. Copy TPFZ/profiles/KZ/loadorder.txt to TPFZ/profiles/KZ 0.9.4.  Confirm overwrite.
		4. Open MO.
		5. The loadorder in the left pane should mostly look like the old KZ order, but with a bunch of new unchecked esps at the end.
		6. Activate Wyre Smash.
		7. Select all, then right click and Check ESL Qualifications.
		8. About a dozen esps can be eslified - we did this for 0.9.3.5, now we need to do it again.  For each esp in the list (they'll be green in the esp list), right click and Set ESL Flag, until no more can be easily eslified.
		9.  Close Wyre Smash.
		10.  In right pane, right click, then Enable All.  Say yes when it confirms.
		11.  If you scroll to end, the highest non-FE Mod Index should be FD or less.  If not, you got work to do to bring that count down - something will have to be disabled.
		12.  Now put all the new mods (the ones that sort after the last mod in the old KX profile) in the right spots.
		13.  In a text editor, outside of MO, open TPF/profiles/R4fined 0.9.4 Experimental/loadorder.txt.  We're just going to be viewing it, not editing, so set it readonly. (In Notepad++, open Edit menu.  At bottom is 'Set Read-Only')
		14. For each new mod in the MO mod list, find it in the open loadorder.txt file.  See what's around it.  Move the mod in the MO list to the same location, or as close as possible.
		15.  When done, use the button to Create a Backup of your load order
		16. Now we need to check that all dependents are positioned after their masters.
		17. Open Wrye Bash
		18. Find "Bash Patch, 0.esp".
		19.  Right click menu, select 'Rebuild Patch ...', down in lower half.
		20.  You will probably get a popup window named 'Master Errors', with panels showing 'Missing Master Errors' (shouldn't be any) and 'Delinquent Master Errors' (may be a few).  If you have many, you'll want to write them down; due to stupidly of Wrye interface, you can't just copy-paste the error list into a new file.
		21.  Close Wrye Bash.  DO NOT just unlock MO underneath it!
		22. Go over to your MO load order, and move any file with a delinquent master (the top ones in the tree, with the required master underneath) to just after it's delinquent master.  Alternatively, move the master before the dependent.  Whatever works for you.  23.  Back up your load order.
		24.  Open Wrye Bash again, try to rebuild bash patch again.  If you get the Missing Master Errors again, keep fixing until you don't.
		25.  If you get the the 'Update Bashed Patch, 0.esp' popup window, just Cancel.  We don't actually want to build a patch, we just wanted to find delinquent and missing masters.
		26.  Close Wrye Bash.
		27.  Make sure every esp that should be enabled is, in fact, enabled.  Click on the column 'Mod Index'  it will show unchecked esps up top.  You may have a few, as TPFZS removed a few mods that you may have made patches for.  Make sure the only unchecked mods are the ones you WANT unchecked, probably because they're missing masters.  Probably best to disable their mods, but not strictly neccessary.  If you make any changes, backup your load order again.
		28.  Make sure there is no little red error triangle in the upper right of MO, indicating Missing Masters.
		28.  Your load order should now be functional!  Time to test it.
		
TESTING
	1.  Start SKSE.  See if the game starts.  If so, you're golden!
	2.  Create a new character.
	3.  Wait for all MCM messages to finish.
	4.  Equip your character with stuff in starting room, but do not choose a fate.
	5.  Save game.
	6.  Quit
	7.  In MO Profile Manage, copy your now-working KZ 0.9.4 profile to a new profile named KZ 0.9.4 Baseline.  You will not edit the new profile, or even use it much.  But it's there to go back to a version known to load.
	8.  Now restart the game, and get to playing!
	
==========================================
2012-05-07  Cleaning up the KZ 0.9.4 Build
==========================================
Active Profile: KZ 0.9.4

RUN Nemesis
	Last night, I forgot to run Nemesis on my new build, so animations would definitely be off.
	Time to do it now.
	1. Insure we have an enabled mod named "(KZ 0.9.4) Nemesis Output".  If it doesn't exist, create it.
	2. Open the mod "Nemesis Output 0.9.4 TPSFZ094" in Explorer (right click, Open in Explorer)
	3. Select and copy everything in it, except meta.ini
	4. Open the mod '(KZ 0.9.4) Nemesis Output in Explorer
	5. Paste everything we just copied into it.  If there is an overwrite warning, say yes, we want to overwrite.
	6.  Open the Modify Executables window.
	7.  Select Nemesis.
	8.  CHECK 'Create file in mod instead of overwrite (*)'
	9.  Insure that the folder named for that option is "(KZ 0.9.4) Nemesis Output"
	10.  Click OK to close the window.
	11.  Run Nemesis.  Update Engine, then Launch Nemesis Behavior Engine.
	12. It should end with the middle bar being a yellow-green, and saying something like "9151 animation(s)".  This number is substantially higher than the number in base TPFZS 0.9.4, because KZ 0.9.4 contains OStim NG, which adds lots of animations, plus some other animation packs.
	13.  Close Nemesis.

TEST
	Start the game and load the save I made last night, with the character still in the starting cell.
	Test things.
	1.  Test if OBody actually changes the body shape (F10 in TPFZS default, F8 in KZ build)
	2.  Test if iEquip works, by adding weapons to the right hand queue.
	
	Did the above, and things are looking good.  Now it's time to actually playtest the sucker more extensively, before diving into today's modifications.

Cleanup
	Remove saves/ folder from newly added profiles in my GIT repository.
	Remove old saves from KZ 0.9.4 profile
	Disable mod 'Nemesis Output 0.9.4 TPSFZ094' in KZ 0.9.4 profile
	
INSTALL:

	DL: NCC2020SE v1.01 6 dec 2020
	Notes: This mod uses some SKSE wizardry to strip you of your prisoner's outfit when the character creation menu opens. This makes it compatible with both vanilla start and all alternate start mods.
	Notes: 	Numerous reports in forum of it not working.  Needs testing.
	Notes:  esp file needs to be eslified

NEW MOD:
	Naked Character Creation v1.01 - KZ eslified esp replacer
	Procedure:  Copy NCC2020.esp to new mod with that name.  activate.  xEdit with just that mod.  Set ESL flag in file header - no compaction needed.  Exit xEdit.
		
TEST:
	Nope, Naked Character Creation doesn't work for me.

UNINSTALL:
	Naked Character Creation 2020 SE
	
INSTALL:
	CBBE 3BA (3BBB) - Settings Loader
	https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/56875
	Created from scratch MCM for CBBE 3BA (3BBB) by Acro748 to support MCM Helper.

	DL: Kri's EWM Custom Compilation v1.1.2 28 jan 2023
	Notes: I CANNOT EMPHASIZE ENOUGH that this DOES NOT CHECK ANYTHING. If you give yourself access to these powers before you've earned them, it's cheating and that's on you.  This was made for my personal load order and is presented AS IS. However if you don't use one or more of these plugins, the mod will still work for you - and just fail with probably a papyrus error if you try to use the ability of a mod you don't have. The ESP itself has no requirements.

	Helnen start.  All good until I have to jump out of tower.  Burning Inn has lots of walls that shouldn't be there, which i can pass through, and are invisible from other side.
	Same thing happens in bruined building I have to run through with Hadvar, after Alduin takes off again - walls that I can pass through.
	Console says they're from DynDOLOD.  When I disable DynDOLOD, the walls vanish, and when I re-enable it, they reappear.  They're definitely the inn walls from before the dragin attack.  And they're not there in vanilla 0.9.4.  I screwed up something, no idea what or how.

	https://www.loverslab.com/blogs/entry/9950-mod-release-karlov-manor-version-40-lese/
	This mod adds a medium sized vampire castle to Skyrim and various screenshot locations (accessible via the carriage in the court or the location access room). It is located in north west of Solitude. 
	Even though normal house usage and gameplay is possible, it is intended for taking screenshots.

	BlockSteal - Prevents accidentally pick up v0.10
	https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/18732
	This mod will prevent you from stealing items. When you try to steal, nothing happens. To steal an item, you have to go in sneak mode, and then you can steal all you like.
	DL: Blocksteal_010_SKSE2017 0.10 22 feb 2020
	Notes: Support for Runtime 1.5.97 (Requires SKSE64 v2.0.17).  Part of Skyrim for Good Guys

	Tidy Up 1.1.2
	https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/34021
	Oh no, you've made a mess. Well, time to put everything right.
	DL: Tidy Up 1.1.2 04 apr 2020
	Notes: As you visit people's houses, maybe even your own house, things can become a bit of a mess. Plates are under the table. A cabbage is rolling down the hallway. How did that pair of gauntlets wind up over there?  This mod lets you sort it all out, one bit of clutter at a time.
	When you launch the game with this mod installed, you'll have a new lesser power, "Tidy Up".  Simply cast it like any other lesser power, and once it's activated, anything that normally you'd be able to pick up now has the option to put back where it belongs; even (especially!) things that don't belong to you!  When you're finished righting everything that's taken a bit of a tumble, cast the power again, to go back to your normal bull-in-a-china-shop self.
	﻿Installation: The archive contains a single ESP-FE plugin and BSA archive. It contains only new record and a few simple scripts.
	Compatibility: It does not work with Block Steal Papyrus﻿.  You can tidy stuff that you do not own, which made me feel like it was going to work, but you always take stuff that has no owner or that you own.  It does work well, however, with BlockSteal - Prevents accidentally pick up﻿﻿.

	KZ Patch - Scamps v0 eslified + TPFZS v094
	
DISABLE:
	iEquip
	Reason:  it's slow, I don't like it, and another user is having problems with MCM recorder restarting after reloading a saved game.  No dependencies, don't need to change anything else.

TESTING:
	Start new game.  Default start.
	Issues:  When trying to look at Alternative Perspectives note in startining cell, failed with error 'Blocksteal.dll could not be loaded'.
	Issue:  Mouse very slow in inventory, despite high FPS
	
	Answer:  From Blocksteal forum: 'on 1.9.57, no animated looting mods, I still get the Blocksteal.dll could not be loaded error  Edit: it was due to eslifying the plugin'
	
DISABLE MOD:
	Blocksteal KZ eslified esp.  Dammit.

TESTING:
	Blocksteal now working fine.
	Wall problem is burning inn in Helgen now gone - moving DynDOLOD did it.
	I got my 'Aldiun not taking off' bug in Helgen again.  It happened during a run where I had DynDOLOD disabled; also, Hadvar got stuck, and only caught up with me again after I ran the gauntlet myself and got into the scene where he and Hadvar exchange words.  When I loaded an earlier save, then enabled DynDOLOD (now working fine), then Aldun and Hadvar worked fine.  Not enough evidence to pin in on DynDOLOD yet, but it's a suspicion.

INSTALL TOOL:
	Synthesis 0.25.4
	https://github.com/Mutagen-Modding/Synthesis/releases
	DL:  0.25.4  Synthesis.zip  4 apr 2023
	Instructions:
		1. Extract to its own folder.  I used C:\Portable Apps\Synthesis 0.25.4
		2. Add as MO2 Executable.  Set output folder to "(KZ 0.9.4) Synthesis Output"
		3. Go to Windows Defender, create Antivirus Exclusion for new Synthesis folder
		4. Run Synthesis in MO2
		5. It will say 'Blocking Error'.  This is because we're using a non-standard Skyrim
		6.  Open Settings (gear icon in upper right).  It will edit the default Skyrim SE profile.
		7. Rename the profile to 'Skyrim SE TPFZS'
		8. Set the Data Folder to the correct patch for your install, e.g. C:\TPFZS\Stock Game\Data
		9. Close Settings by clicking back arrow button in upper left.
		10. Click on the 'Git Repository' button, the one that looks life a tree diagram.
		11. Select 'HighPolyHead-RaceMenuPatcher'
		12. Now in left pane, click on the arrow to run Synthesis.
		13. Wait.  With just the HPH Patcher, it took 37.4 seconds on my rig, and I got an error - Too Many masters 294 > 254
		
	
SET UP SYNTHESIS to HANDLE A HUGE LOAD Order
	Ok, this is tricky.   A single esp can only have 254 masters, so to get Synthesis to fix 285+ esps, I need it to generate 2 different patches, each handling only a fraction of my load order.  Fortunately, this is easy to do.
	1.  Click on the 'Synthesis' entry in the laft pane.  This will being up a right pane with the name 'Synthesis' up top, and a selection window for 'Blacklisted Mods'
	2.  Rename that patcher!  Click on 'Synthesis' in the right pane, and change 'Synthesis' to 'Synthesis HPH RaceMenuPatcher 1'.
	3.  Create a *second* Synthesis patcher group, by clicking on the indented tree icon in the upper left.  This will create a new unnamed group.
	4.  Name the new group 'Synthesis HPH RaceMenuPatcher 2'.
	5.  Add the HPH RaceMenu Patcher to the new group, same as you did before.  You will be a popup saying 'Duplicate Patcher Name'.  Rename the new patcher by adding a '2' to the end.
	6.  Re-enable TPFZS 0.9.4 Synthesis output mod.  This is just for a while.
	7.  Click on the arrow at the bottom left to run both your Synthesis groups.
	8.  Close Synthesis
	9.  You should now have two new esps in your Synthesis output:  'Synthesis RaceMenuPatcher 1.esp' and 'Synthesis RaceMenu Patcher 2.esp'.  Bith should be relatively small, under 2 megs, because they only contain patches that aren't already in the TPFZS Synthesis.esp.
	10.  Disable the TPFZS 0.9.4 Synthesis Output mod.
	11.  In the left plugins pane, enable both new mods.
	12.  Move 'Synthesis HPH RaceMenuPatcher 1.esp' *much* earlier in your load order.  I recommend trying just before LCO_Framework.esp, to start.   
	13.  Rerun Synthesis.  Open it, click on the blue arrow down on the bottom left.
	14.  If you get an error saying 'Too Many Masters' when generating, then you need to move the 'Patcher 1' esp either up or down in your load order.  If the error was while generating patcher 1, then you need to move it lower.  If the error was generating pather 2, then move patcher 1 later.  Leave patcher 2 at the very end of your load order.  Keep re-running Synthesis until you get a good run with no errors.
	15.  Close Synthesis.
	16.  DO NOT bother setting the ESL flag on either of the two generated synthesis patches.  Yes, they can be easily eslified.  But the next time they're generated, Synthesis will create regular ESPs again.  Don't waste your time.
	17.  Start Skyrim, and test your new patches.  With any luck, all your NPCs will look exactly like they did before, and you will see no difference whatsoever.  Magic!
	
	Why are we going to all this trouble?  What does the HPH RaceMenu patcher do?  All it does it change the main race records to use High-Poly heads by default, rather than standard low-poly ones.  This is done *SOLELY* to ease character generation in a new game, as new characters will start with HP heads rather than ugly old low-poly ones.  But in order to get all the head meshes of the existing NPCs to still use the old low poly heads that they were built with, their records need to be patched, to explicitly add low-poly head parts that were previously assumed by default.
	
	Needless to say, this means patching virtually every NPC record in the game, save for those that were overwritten by HPH NPC overhauls. Which means patching a huge number of plugins - possibly more than 254, which is the maximum number of masters a single esp can have.  TPFZS is patching less than 254 esps, so it can get away with standard Synthesis generation.  By my load order adds lots of mods with new NPCs, and goes over the 254 limit.  (Note this had nothing to do with the limit of 254 esps; this is a limit on the number of *masters* listed in the header of a single esp, whether those masters are esps, esls, or espfes.)

	So, the get the master count down in the Synthesis-generated patches, we need to create multiple patches, each affecting only a fraction of the esps that need to be patched.   Fortunately, Synthesis makes this easy, in two ways.  First, a synthesis patch will ONLY look at plugins that precede it in the load order; thus, our patch 1 is somewhere in the middle, so it only patches the first N plugins, where N < 254.  Second, a synthesis patch will NOT patch things that don't need to be patched; thus, our patch 2 will ignore all the plugins already patched by patch 1.

	Yes, we need to create 2 different Synthesis patches, with two different names.  But this is easily done by creating two 'groups' of patchers, where each group creates a different patch.
	
	If you want to add more patchers in the future, then you almost certainly want to add them to patch group 2, which is at the end of the load order, and can affect every plugin in the load order.  Feel free to rename either patch group if you like; you can put patch group 2 back to simply 'Synthesis' if you want.  Whatever you name a group, that will be the name of the generated esp.  Definitely use as few groups as possible, so as not to use precious esp slots.
	
	Do we even *need* this Synthesis patch at all?  Not really.  If you're like me, and never create new characters from scratch, but simply use HPH presets downloaded from Nexus that look *way* better than anything I could create myself, then this whole HPH RaceMenuPatcher thing is totally pointless, and can be safely removed.  Recall, most of the work is patching NPCs so they *don't* look any different, despite the Race records being changed to use HighPoly heads by default, for convenience during character generation.  Peronsally, I plan to chuck the things, because I want the esp slots and don't care if HP heads are default.  But if you like creating lots of new characters from scratch, and want them all to use high-poly heads by default, your feelings may differ.

	Notes:  Mod of the Month April 2023
	DL: FloatingSwordFollower.zip 1.08 10 may 2023
		Skeever Daumbra Patch.7z  1.6 12 apr 2023
		XEDIT filter for finding suitable candidates for Daumbra's body (xEdit script)
	NOT REQUIRED BUT STRONGLY SUGGESTED:
		- Skeever﻿﻿﻿﻿ - Mod of the Month for April 2021, the follower with the most lines ever made (15 thousand and counting) adds a thousand lines more to comment and advice every step of the way for "There Is No Umbra" Chapters I and II (and Kerstyn herself recorded over a hundred new lines as well). It was an honor collaborating together for the patch. You can download it from the optional files section. See the video at: https://youtu.be/GkZQBq_3pcw﻿
		- Vibrant Weapons﻿ - Combined with a patch already included in the FOMOD, this will make her produce real light. Very cool. Don't forget to use the Power from that mod to enable effects on NPCs (note: if the light from Vibrant Weapons is too strong for you, there is now an alternative ENB Light﻿ patch from PraedythXVI also in the FOMOD installer. ENB Light is not as bright and works whether the sword is sheathed or not).
		- Disable Follower Collision﻿ - it's a beautiful piece of SKSE witchcraft so that you will never again be blocked by your own housecarl while backing out of a small room!
		Equipment Enchantment Fix﻿ - This may help you if sometimes her flames don't turn on.
		- Iconic's Azura's Star Dungeon Retexture﻿ - This will make your visuals match the Chapter II trailer. It's so gorgeous.
		Praedy's Soul Cairn - SE﻿ - Speaking of gorgeous, this makes Umbriel look amazing.
		- Combat Gameplay Overhaul﻿ - or any other similar mod that makes you lean in the direction in which you are moving. This will make the hoverboard riding look and feel gorgeous -and you can wield her one-handed.
		- Better Jumping SE﻿ - This will allow you to jump while in 'hoverboard' mode. Combined with CGO it makes for smooooth shock-absorption motion -see the video.
		- Your favorite camera mod - The combat custom animations are all 3rd person, but with some of these mods they can be 1st person too! 
		- There is no (CC) Umbra﻿ - A kind soul made a patch that resolves the lore conflict between this mod and the Creation Club's version. 
		- WIDeadBodyCleanupScript Crash Fix﻿ - Depending on your choices some vanilla NPCs may or may not die, and this mod addresses a vanilla bug that sometimes produced crashes when that happened.
		- Dragonactorscript infinite loop fix﻿ - Similar to above, this will probably save you some headaches with script lag and Papyrus.
	COMPATIBLITY
		- The FOMOD already includes some patches for minor things, like book covers, or other quests which also touch certain vanilla points -nothing huge.
		- PCEA: PCEA is fine, but make sure it doesn't overwrite 2hm_sprintforwardsword.hkx so that the DAR version wins over and you can sword-surf.
		- SkySA: I don't use it, but people in my discord say it works fine as long as you delete the SkySA 2-handed attacks and 2-handed sprint animations so you can use the ones from this mod.
		- MCO: I don't use it either, but a very friendly ape in the discord (he asked me to refer to him that way!) made an MCO patch which is included in the FOMOD, that uses Black's animation from mods Sswayed commissioned and gave persm for. Apologies I can't give technical support on it, since, again, I don't use MCO myself.
		- AFT, NFF, etc.: DO NOT import her into any follower management system. She has her own. Of course, you can have your other followers in your favorite follower management system; that's just fine for them -but not her. The NFF patch is no longer required -uninstall it if you were using it before.
		- The T'Skyrim patch is also no longer required -uninstall it if you were using it before. As of Chapter III, the mod no longer touches the Atronach Forge formlists, so it no longer needs that kind of patches. 
		- Immersive Citizens or similar mods which change the AI packages of vanilla NPCs: make sure my mod loads last in the load order. I can't stress this enough.
		- Synthesis Patcher﻿, Wyre Bash, Merges, etc: Do not include this mod. This mod doesn't merge well, it needs to be by itself.
		- Immersive Equipment Displays﻿ -Make sure to use the "Daumbra Exclude" json settings, included in the FOMOD (thanks Waddles!).

	Sunder and Wraithguard - Editable Vault Cell (Cell Bug Workaround)
	https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/59083
	Sunder and Wraithguard is unfortunately set up as an ESM flagged ESL, which means that any mod attempting to touch its new cell, or any of the linked references in Sightless Pit, cause the cell to break. This workaround creates a copy of the cell and repoints all necessary parts of the Creation, allowing other mods to edit the contents.

	Notes:  DO NOT ESLIFY!  The whole point of this mod is that it's not flagged ESL, thus allowing other mods to edit the cell.

	Notes: I have permission from original author (triptherift) to post this version, provided I NEVER upload it to Nexus Mods. By downloading this version you must also agree to this condition, NEVER upload it to Nexus Mods. Also, nothing contained in the mod can be used for paid modding sites, ever.

	Adds a shell-shocked and totally insane former soldier to the game.
	DL: main v Insane2 10 jul 2021
	LOOT: with other followers, after Kaidan
	Notes: Kels just wanders around Solitude, because she doesn't have any family to return home to. She goes to the tavern in the evening. She has no place to live, so some of her soldier friends that feel sorry for her let her sneak into Castle Dour at night. She sleeps by a fireplace in the dungeon.
	- Use a mod manager. Any one will do. The esp is esl flagged (espfe), one of the very few added voice line followers built that way. The assets are packed into a compressed archive to keep the mod footprint low. She is CBBE Slim based, but for crying out loud, don't ruin my day and put her into some silly bikini boob armor. Seriously. You have thousands of hyper-inflated T&A smash dolls to choose from for that. This chick is unwashed, smelly, ugly, and obnoxious. Why would you even bother?

	The Marrying Kind - Cinderella 1.2
	https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/55509
	A mod loosely inspired by the story Aschenputtel, by the Brothers Grimm. Based on a folk tale that has roots in many cultures around the world - stories of a simple, poor girl that dreams of a better future.
	DL: main 1.2 12 nov 2021
	Notes:
		- Cheap supermarket romance novel quality intro dialogue (You know - cringe-worthy 50 Shades stuff)
		- Different dialogue paths for male versus female suitors (aye, she's looking for a Prince, so females will initially fail, and will have to convince her)
		- The thrill of victory, or the agony of defeat (in love)
		- You only get one shot at catching her fancy, so don't mess up your opportunity - make wise choices
		- She can follow you, but has no skills or weapon, and is very timid, so you will have to protect her (this is by design, and no I won't change it)
		- Custom hand sculpted UNP-based body and textures
		- Custom outfit made just for her
		- Mod is archived (compressed bsa format) to keep the mod footprint low
		- Scripts are just small fire and forget fragments to move the story along (sources included)
		- When in follower mode, she will stay at whatever location you dismiss her at, as she has no home
		- As this uses the vanilla Marriage quest, when the option of where to live comes up, be sure to set YOUR home to live at, or you will have a big problem
		- Never, ever, open up a mod like this in the CK. Any save you make will generate new (very ugly) facegen files. Use xEdit. Seriously.
		- esp is flagged as esl (espfe)

	https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/45082
	A set of new Threesome sex animations for OStim. MMF and FFM included.
	Notes: Finding the animations in Manual mode
		To start a threesome scene in OStim, make sure you have OSex's Dual Wield plugin, then:
		- Start a 2 person scene -> Select sub actor tab (hit "9" by default) -> page right, press your body against him/her -> tab bottom (9, again), Invite someone to join 
		- These animations are sorted into 2 "trees", one for MMF animation and one for MFF animations.  The first bottom tab is the Sub actors menu, which is the MMF scenes. The second bottom tab is the third actor's menu, with the MFF scenes contained within it. You can list them all quickly by using OSearch and searching " " (an empty space) while a threesome scene is running. This will pull up a list of all threesome animations (make sure you are using the latest version of OStim and OSearch).
		- Want the roles flipped around in FFM anims? go to Osa's "arrange" menu (press the enter key on your numpad) and flip the position between the sub and the male two actor (the one with the yellow circle). then proceed to the animations
		
	OCum Ascended - Cum and Orgasm Mechanics for OStim 2.2

	OCum Ascended is an overhaul and rewrite of OCum, an OStim addon which adds cum effects, physical cum projectiles, womb size, cum inflation mechanics, female squirting during orgasms, and many other orgasm features. Fully replaces the original OCum, as mods that require OCum will work with OCum Ascended out of the box.
	DL: main 2.2 23 nov 2022
	Notes: - OCum Ascended now has its own separate MCM menu with new and more options. Do NOT use the OCum MCM options in the OStim MCM Addons tab. They won't work! It's highly recommended to also use OCum Ascended - Cum and Orgasm Mechanics for OStim - Settings Loader, courtesy of MaskedRPGFan!

NEW MOD - ESLIFICATION
	Caesia Ostim Patch 1.0 - KZ eslified esp replacer
	
INSTALL:
	OPubes 1.0
	https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/64151/
	Addon for OBody that distributes female pubic hair textures from a number of packs. You can easily create patches in the form of JSON files too.
	DL: 1.0 23 feb 2022
	
	Naughty Voices for OStim 1.4
	https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/74765
	This is the next-generation replacement for OVoice. It provides additional features and superior playback performance.
	DL: main 1.4 29 nov 2022
	- Like OVoice, Naughty Voices causes actors to use their natural voices in OStim scenes.  Currently, like OVoice, this is limited to OSA/OStim's actor2, females in the sub role.  Unlike OVoice, it will work on a female player character and you can even choose which voice you want your character to use in an MCM.  If you do not choose, it will use your character's natural voice (yes, the game assigns your character a voice based on race).
	- This version of Naughty Voices is compatible with ColdSun's Vayne and Coralyn.
	
	OMerchants - OStim merchants with benefits 1.0
	https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/80141
	An OStim addon that allows merchants to give Dragonborn a temporary discount in exchange for sex.
	DL: main 1.0 06 dec 2022
	- The mod adds a few seduction lines. Approach the merchant and select the randomized dialogue line. If the seduction is successful (50% chance by default, customizable in MCM), the merchant will follow you for a short time, so you can choose a more intimate place for the OStim scene. You can also turn off the follow feature in the MCM.
	- If the merchant orgasmed, the shop menu will open with applied discount after the scene ends. This effect stacks with other vanilla and modded speech effects (Ordinator perks for example). You need to wait for cooldown to end before you try to approach a merchant again.
	
	OAroused 1.2
	https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/57232
	Arousal mechanics in OStim. Stat buffs, changes to scene length when aroused, and more.
	D: 1.4 18 oct 2021
	- Arousal and the algorithm: Arousal goes up for everyone in the game all of the time. Each NPC has a unique arousal-gain speed, so it's different for everyone (the player's is always the same). To simulate off-screen sex or masturbation, if you have not been near an NPC for several days, their arousal will reset to something else. Max arousal for the player is usually reached in 4-5 days  with no orgasms
	- Arousal drops when a character has an orgasm in a OStim scene. The longer the build-up to the orgasm, the greater the arousal release will be. This means if you start a scene and speed up the scene to max speed and quickly finish, you will have less of an arousal drop (but still a sizable one)
	- Arousal also slightly rises over the course of an OStim scene. Also, if a character finishes a scene without orgasming, their arousal spikes considerably. This also means that kisses from ORomance raise arousal a lot.
	- Special scene-ending feature: You can enable a setting in the MCM to change how OStim scenes can end with OAroused installed. With "Require low arousal to end scene" enabled, OStim scenes will prefer not to end until your arousal reaches 0. Specifically, if you have "End on Dom Orgasm" enabled, and your player character is the dom actor, the end event for you will not fire until your arousal is low. The same happens if your character is the sub actor with "End on Sub Orgasm" enabled. With this feature, if your character enters a scene with high arousal and orgasm doesn't empty it completely, your character will continue on with the scene until they're not longer aroused.
	- On-screen bar: By pressing right-ctrl, a bar similar to OCum's will appear to show you how aroused your character is. Key remappable.
	- Raising nearby NPC's arousal with nudity & OStim scenes: If your character or anyone else sees an OStim scene in progress, their arousal will skyrocket.
	- Optionally, if your player is naked or is wearing armor with the EroticArmor keyword attached, nearby NPCs will become more aroused as well. This feature is disabled by default, since it must do small script polls when your character is naked (they are still light on performance) . Which brings us to performance
	- Performance: Without the above nudity feature on, OAroused does not perform any script polling or use any script cloaks. OAroused only runs it's single script during OStim scenes. Beyond that it only runs a brief check on the player every 6 in-game hours to see if stat buffs need to be updated. OAroused was designed for performance and long-term stability, and uses an almost identical stat system to OCum, which tracked semen and semen generation for all NPCs like how OAroused tracks arousal.
	
	OVirginity 1.3.1
	https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/45563

	OVirginity Reflowered 2.1.0

	OVirginity Reflowered is an overhaul and rewrite of OVirginity, an OStim addon which adds a female virginity system with visual and sound effects. ESP flagged ESL, so it won't take a slot in your load order. Fully replaces the original OVirginity, as mods that require OVirginity will work with OVirginity Reflowered out of the box.
	DL: main 2.1 06 nov 2022
		OVirginity Reflowered JSON Configuration File 2.1 03 nov 2022
	Requires: OCum Ascended
	- OVirginity Reflowered now has its own separate MCM menu with new and more options. Do NOT use the OVirginity MCM options in the OStim MCM Addons tab. They won't work! It is highly recommended that you also use OVirginity Reflowered - Settings Loader so you can keep your settings across different characters.

	ORomance 1.8
	https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/48564
	Extensive new dating and seduction mechanics, a brand new user interface, prostitution mechanics, cheating mechanics, and countless new features, built for OStim
	DL: main 1.8 18 oct 2021
	- No, don't ESL-flag this mod
	- To start ORomance, simply approach an NPC and press the ORomance hotkey while facing them. This will start a special dialogue with the ORomance menu available. You now have many options available to you
	- ORomance is a massive mod, there's no way to explain all of it's new features here, but here's the big ones:
	- Dating, romance, and seduction mechanics in Skyrim. Loosely based off of classic dating sims
	- A brand new UI built from the ground up to make navigating ORomance's many options a breeze
	- A new relationship type, girlfriend or boyfriend, acts as an intermediate between friends and marriage
	- divorce/breakup/cheating/multiple partners/threesomes, all features in ORomance
	- EVERY NPC is romancable/seducable/marriable, even those NPCs added in new mods (some NPCs may be hard to get, see below)
	- Brand new custom stats (over 10) and personalities procedurally generated for each npc, because Skyrim's relationship mechanics were far too basic
	- NPCs have an opinion/"memory" of you that will fade over time for small actions, but they will remember some things you do with them forever
	- Loads of new interaction options with NPCs
	- Prostitution, where you can pay different prices for different sex acts
	- Ultra-tight OStim integration, your actions inside sex scenes affect your relationship
	- Followers like you the more you travel with them
	- Optional NPC sexualities (heterosexual/bisexual/homosexual) that affects their preferences in the player
	- Loads of small immersive tweaks that tie into the game's vanilla systems. Becoming a thane makes you more popular around town? Of course. Not being orc-kin makes seducing orcs harder? Absolutely. Doing quests for NPCs makes starting relationships with them easier? Yep.
	- Heavy emphasis on small immersive features
	
	
	OProstitution 1.4
	https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/64148
	Adds the ability to work as a prostitute
	DL: main 1.4 
	Requirements:  OAroused, OCum, ORomance, OStim, OVirginity
	- Make sure you have installed OAroused and OProstitution correctly. OAroused is a dependency and OProstitution should overwrite it. Make sure OProstitution wins conflicts and is lower in your load order than OAroused.
	- Looking to play as a prostitute? OProstitution brings many new hours of gameplay and plenty of roleplay opportunity. Based loosely on the famous Your Market Stall mod, you'll be setting up your own sex business and completing detailed jobs.
	- The Lantern
	- At a forge, you can craft a Prostitution Lantern. This special lantern glows light red, and is used to signal to customers that you are a prostitute. After crafting the lantern, open your inventory and drop it on the ground and it will magically set itself up. You can move it again by pressing E on it
	- With a lantern placed down, as long as you are within about 30 meters of it, clients will know you're a prostitute and begin approaching you with sex offers.
	- Prostitute sex
	- Most clients will have specific sexual requests that you must fulfill during the act to receive payment. You can view all active requests by holding the ORomance key during sex. There is a large variety of requests clients may have. Some clients have special requests they can make too. Clients may refuse to pay if you do not complete all of their requests.
	- Working for a store owner, licensing, and prostitution in public
	- Prostitution is illegal in Skyrim without a license. You can purchase a license at the lantern for 2500 septims, however, early on you may want to work inside an inn, or maybe even a store, where you won't be caught not having a license. You can set up shop inside any store, inn, or business in Skyrim and the store owner will automatically take a cut of your profits. The amount they take is dependent on their ORomance personality. A small few may take the entirety of your profits. Note that on the OProstitution screen, the payout shown already has the owner's cut deducted.
	- Misc features Having your lantern in the same area for a long period of time will "warm up" that area, and your approach rate will increase, since people know where to find you easily.
	- Recommended mods Since this mod has heavy roleplay potential and involves hanging around one area, I recommend a few mods that may improve the experience:
		SkyrimSouls, so time passes while in your inventory
		Mods that let you place down furniture like Campfire addons
		YourMarketStall if you want to run a shop alongside your current business
		Mods that add more npcs
		Mods that make NPC AI more complex and travel around more often

	Amorous Adventures PLUS - OStim and OpenSex Edition 1.1.0
	https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/76046
	A rework and rebuild of the original Amorous Adventures, now ported to OStim using OpenSex animations!
	DL: main v1.1.0
	- It is highly recommended that you load the Amorous Adventures PLUS esp plugin within the first 128 plugins in your load order. That is including ESMs, ESLs and ESP-FEs. If you find that too difficult, make sure it does not go over plugin position 200th in your load order.  This is due to a very possible Skyrim engine bug, where mods which add many dialogues (such as quest mods like Amorous Adventures) will have their dialogues disappearing if you load them very late in your load order. So please, load Amorous Adventures PLUS as early as possible to avoid the disappearing dialogue bug.

	Twins 1.11
	https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/10598-twins/
	Meet Danielle and Dahlia, twin sisters from Cyrodiil. They have come to Skyrim for some adventure. Unfortunately for them their adventure has gone sideways. They have been captured by bandits and are being held for who-knows-what nefarious purpose (this is LoversLab after all). If you choose to rescue them they will be happy to follow you and add to your adventures.
	- They can be found in the last indoor cell of Silent Moons Camp
	- Both will follow you but neither is marriageable (see Notes below)
	- Danielle is a berserker and prefers two-handed weapons and heavy armor
	- Dahlia is a combat archer and prefers bows and light armor
	- Regardless of your follower framework neither should impact your stealth
	- Both have perks in their respective weapon/armor
	- Both are naked when you find them so they have no "recurring" weapons or armors that pop up when you least want them
	- ESP file.
	- DO NOT INSTALL until eslified.  may be an LE format mod

One of these checks is entirely nonsensical: after giving the Dragonstone to Farengar, if the player goes outside Whiterun, the first stage of Dragon Rising ("talk to Jarl Balgruuf") is auto-completed by the game. This script fix corrects this silly error by silly Bethesda and makes it so the player can safely adventure outside Whiterun without having the game autocomplete a quest stage, because that's just silly.
	Mod Order: early, with other fixes, after Vanilla Script (micro) Optimizations

TEST:
	Boot the game.  Make sure it runs.
	Uhoh.  CTD during MCM initialization in opening room.
	(Note: OBody says I have 241 female bodies, and 54 male ones)
	Crash log in overwrite/NetScriptFramework/Crash  suggest trouble is in evgSIRENROOTthecausepatch.esp
	
REINSTALL:
	Suspect possible problem due to scrips/assets between SSE versions.   Sirenroot needs 1.6.640 AE assets, including scripts.  I'm going to reinstall my StockGame as 1.6.640, then run the downgrade patcher to create a 'Best of Both Worlds' install.

	DL: Kozakowy's Mythic Dawn Priestess Outfit CBBE - SSE - ESL  1.2.1 15 may 2021
	- Q. [For CBBE Users] Why do my hands look different?
		A. The Mythic Dawn Priestess Outfit uses a custom body sculpt, which is based on the CBBE body from Skyrim Legendary Edition. There are changes in the mesh, including it's shape, between CBBE Legendary Edition and CBBE Special Edition. When equipping the Mythic Dawn Priestess Outfit your character's body is also changed out for the custom sculpted CBBE Legendary Edition body, which has a different mesh shape around the wrists, resulting in a large gap between the hands and the arms. To fix this gap, the CBBE Legendary Edition hands have been included as a part of the 'body swap' when equipping the Mythic Dawn Priestess outfit.

	Sette's Smol Mod - Blacksmithing Tutorial Freedom 1.0 Sette
	https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/57625
	Enough is enough! You shouldn't be crafting those useless iron dagger and hide helmet for the 100th time. Craft anything at the forge for the tutorial quest.
	- With this nifty, extremely small ESPFE plugin that I made in the matter of minutes, the blacksmiths (Adrienne, Lod, and Alvor) will stop being so picky about it and allow you to craft any weapon for the "iron dagger crafting & tempering" part, and any piece of armor for the "hide helmet crafting & tempering" part of the tutorial.
	- Any mention of iron dagger and hide helmet has been removed from the quest objective texts to reflect these changes. The blacksmiths' dialogue are not changed from vanilla, however, so they'll still refer to the gear you should craft as "iron dagger" and "hide helmet". But that's only a tiny bit of inconsistency that you have to live with.

	- for use with Campfire and Go To Bed
	- Because the animations are made to be paired, if you're laying on your own sometimes it will look... lonely. There's no way to fix this other than using animations that look nice both ways, which I probably won't add because it defeats the purpose of this mod-- snuggling. If you're worried about this though, the Replacer Only version is a good alternative if you prefer the idle.

	Mascot's Integrated Creation Club Spells (MICCS) using SPID 0.45
	https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/69983
	Ever thought it odd how only the Dragonborn can learn the new Creation Club spells? The idea of this mod is to fix that. Using SPID, it adds the creation club spells to NPC's, so you will see necromancers summoning Foul Zombies, mages casting Elemental Flare, and any other spells I can find and add

	https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/43410
	A seductive but moderate walking animation replacer.
	This replaces the default walking animation only (not running, sprint, sneak or anything else). I like it because it's pretty sexy and feminine, but maybe not so "over the top" as others, so it may be more to the taste of other players.
	
	Conditional Gender Animations (DAR) 1.3
	https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/73446
	All female NPCs and the player use gender specific animations depending on their armor type. Lydia for example uses female animations when wearing light armor/no armor and uses male animations (as in vanilla) when wearing heavy armor.

		Being naked around guards will cost you a 5 gold fine each time they see you
		Guards will accost you for being naked
		Being naked around children is now a crime with 100 gold bounty each time they see you
		Children will run away in fear when they see you naked
		You can be naked in your own home or the wilderness
		Friendly NPCs (such as your own children) won't report you
		You can avoid bounties if you sneak and remain undetected

	- NPCs now won't ignore their own nakedness
		NPCs will now run away after you strip them via pickpocketing
		Already naked NPCs (such as bathing hunters) won't be affected
		NPCs with high priority quest AI packages (such as followers) won't be affected
		NPCs that still retain their clothing in their inventory (such as during lewd animations) won't be affected
		Hostile NPCs (such as bandits) will still attack you if they detect you
	- If you want to disable 1 of these effects while retaining the other, simply delete the appropriate SPID configuration and wait for NPCs to respawn

		ESM flagged (for 3291 temporary references),
		Fixed DynDOLOD and Papyrus errors for KA_AdditemOnActivate, KA_RevFogSCRIPT, KA_TWprojectileScript (These scripts do not exist in the mod and are used by records that are not used by anything and were probably leftovers not removed when the mod was finished being created).
		Armature DLC2MiraakBootsAA [ARMA:XX02B0F5] for KA_DLCArmorMiraakBootsLGT "Miraak's Greaves" [ARMO:XX0E5289], so they are visible on the character or mannequin. (Thank you newgene88 for the info!)

	DL: main 1.0
	- Fixes the CTD caused by Spriggans when running both TrueHUD and Skyrim Platform 2.6 at the same time.
	- Removes the (visual) SprigAOEExplosion from the SprigganCallEffect. The Spriggan's Call spell should still function.
	- ESL flagged.
	- Does an Explosion require a model to work properly (SprigAOEExplosion has a model: Effects\FXEmptyObject.nif)? If not, removing Effects\FXEmptyObject.nif in SprigAOEExplosion did the trick for me, without having to remove the entire SprigAOEExplosion.
	- Hm, I didn't consider that just stripping the effect of the Empty Object nif would fix it. If you are reporting it does, then great, I will look into that too. Your solution may just be better.

	VIGILANT SE - Adjustments and Addons 1.0

	VIGILANT will forever remain as one of the greatest mods ever made for Skyrim. I just aim to to make some adjustments to make the experience more blanaced and rewarding, without the rewards feeling overpowered.
	DL: Nerfed Rewards 1.1
		Vigilant No Boss Summons 1.0
	- Its only and biggest flaw (to me at least), is that its rewards slightly undermine the entire experience, since after having finished this mod, the items you found along the way turn any and every enemy into fodder, no matter how hard your modded setup might be.
	
	Sensual Hagraven - A Hagraven Replacer vFINAL  DarkRavage
	https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/56980
	A sexy Hagraven replacer
	DL: Hagraven - No Glemoril Witch vFINAL - This version removed all Glenmoril witches reference so it can be used with New Hagraven by PSBOSS
	Though Hagravens are supposedly old witches, this is a immersive lore-friendly way of re-imagining of them as beautiful but deadly witches. They deceive denizens of Skyrim with their beauty and experiment on them. Overall this is a Hagraven replacer that replaces all named Hagravens and few unique Hagravens I deemed worthy. Hagravens use CBBE bodies with custom textures I put together. Technically they can equip other humanoid outfits and gears.
	
	Sensual Hagraven - A Hagraven Replacer - ESPFE Patch 1.0.1 DarkRavage and MaskedRPGFan
	https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/72162

	Coven - Enemy witches overhaul 1.5
	https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/51596
	Small lightweight mod that will add over 60 enemies to your game. My goal is to expand upon the sadly neglected hagraven faction while being consistent within vanilla framework. No more laughable vanilla level 4 and 8 witches with no perks, now they will level up to 60 and have standard caster perks.
	DL: Coven - Enemy Witches Overhaul
		Coven - Mysticism Distr File to use with SPID
	- Witches and hagravens will use familiar summons, patch to add mysticism poison spells can be found in the optional files. I mostly made this mod because it's one faction, heritage and other mods typically do not cover.
	- Version 1.2 Features completely new outfits for witches which contains some of the farm clothes as well as new Ancient Nord Robes by Norive.

	This mod allows you to attend Vittoria's Vici wedding, after you destroy the Dark Brotherhood.
	DL: Vittorias Alternate Wedding 1.3.1
		Vittorias Alternate Wedding - AI Overhaul Patch
	- If you finished the quest Destroy the Dark Brotherhood AND you have visited Solitude at least once (have Roggvir's execution scene play out fully), it will take about 2 days for a courier to arrive with an invitation to the Vittoria's wedding. When you read the invitation, the quest will start.
	- Then you can go to Solitude, attend the wedding, talk to the guests and newly weds and listen to Vittoria's speech.
	- In addition, there was this weird man at Vittoria's house that used the same bed as her, despite not being mentioned anywhere or related, so I gave him another bed.
	- Known conflicts: (thanks to wowfr for poiting these out)

	Auri - Thistlefoot Should Stay Outdoors 1.1.0
	https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/82688
	Auri is an excellent companion mod by Waribiki. She has a custom deer she rides name Thistlefoot. Depending on other mods you might use, Thistlefoot likes to follow you indoors or into cities. The game disapproves of this and can crash. Thanks to this patch, Thistlefoot Should Stay Outdoors.
	DL: main 1.1.0
	- I would highly suggest also installing my other Auri fix, the Auri AI Dismount Fix which makes sure that Auri actually dismounts off Thistlefoot when you dismount your horse.
	
	Auri - Dismount AI fix 1.1.0
	https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/57976
	Some people have reported that Auri will not dismount off Thistlefoot reliably. This script replacer aims to address that by waiting a bit longer to see if the player is dismount before evaluating her AI package. This probably also fixes some of the CTD that is associated with Thistlefoot being ridden into places that can't have mounts.
	DL: main 1.1.0
	- comments report that this fix is unreliable.  May be better to just ditch the deer altogether and give her a real horse.  see Auri - Song of the Green - QoL Patches and Changes
	
	Auri - Song of the Green - QoL Patches and Changes 1.1
	https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/71603
	Some Quality of Life patches and changes for Auri. I.e. Wildcat, Convenient Horses.
	DL: main 1.1
	- Changes:
		Buy Bone Arrows at the Drunken Huntsman. - Auri always tells me those are sold there. Now they are. Two files, one vanilla, one for MLU.
		Auri and Wildcat - Changed her combat style to fit into Wildcat.
		No ride summoning - As much as I like the style of Thistlefoot, I always prefered the mount handling of Convenient Horses. With this patch, Auri won't summon her own ride anymore, so you can give her a horse. Should work with other ride management mods too. She still refers to her horse as Thistlefoot and keeps her riding comments.
		Let's go to bed. Auri is a child of the forest. So it doesn't make sense that she refuses the Dragonborn in the wilderness. ;) She still wont let you get too close in areas that are flagged 'clearable'. Ie dungeons, bandit camps... No other changes here.

	Morgaine - Fully Voiced Standalone Follower 2.2.2 GhostWarrior13000
	https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/41027
	A standalone fully voiced follower for Skyrim SE
	DL: main 2.2.2
	- Morgaine is not your typical follower. She is a unique and powerful companion who requires a certain level of patience to handle, because this woman loves to talk, she doesn't shut up. Her dialogue is best suited for players who have already discovered their true nature as Dragonborn and met the Greybeards and Paarthurnax.
	- Finding Morgaine: Embark on a mini-quest to find Morgaine's location in the marshes north of Morthal. As you journey through the land, you'll discover more about Morgaine's story and the extinct elven race she belongs to. When you finally find her, you'll be rewarded with two custom spells designed specifically for Morgaine's use.
	- esp file.  new cells for her house.  could be eslified, but unsafe if i ever want to patch.  better to merge?
	
	ColdSun's Pantheon - Legends - Morgaine - Replacer 1.0

	A replacer for the popular follower mod "Morgaine" by GhostWarrior13000. FOMOD and ESL-Flagged ESP. Supports 3BA, BHUNP, and CBBE.
	DL: ColdSun's Pantheon - Legends - Morgaine - 3BA 1.0 19 may 2023
	- This is one of those mods that I just got a whim to make a replacer for based on a suggestion in Discord. A friend, Gonzeh, mentioned this follower who is voiced by the talented Kerstyn Unger. I decided to go look at the mod page and then I was doomed. I had to make a replacer. Ancient Elf? Check. White hair? Check (you folks know I have a weakness for white-haired girls). Kerstyn voiced her. Home run. So I was a bad bad man and diverted some of my time to make this replacer for Morgaine by GhostWarrior13000. Thanks a lot, Gonzeh. No really, I mean it - thanks. She was fun to make and I like how she came out.
	
	Morgaine - COCO Witchiness 1.0 Gonzeh84
	https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/91715
	DL: main 1.0
	- ColdSun just released his fantastic replacer for the amazing Morgaine by GhostWarrior13000. She's always been one of my goto followers and ColdSuns replacer brings much needed consistency with the rest of his replacers I use.
	- This is just a quick patch that gives her ﻿[COCO] Witchiness. Link is in the requirements :)
	- Her default outfit is DX Necromancer Robes which are still great but don't come with SMP and I love me some SMP. Witchiness I felt was very fitting to the replacer.

INSTALL:

	https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/76750
	- xEdit script
	
	
ESMIFY:
	The following mods were created using the Persistentify Those Plugins script, which does everything neccessary (so it says) to safely convert an esp file to an esm.  The reason for doing this is to reduce reference counts, of which there is a limit of a million in game, and since references get genetaed at runtime as critters are spawned, items are dropped, and so on, it's possibly to exceed the million limit in a long game.  However, a large part of the problem is that the Skyrim egine is really designed to run esm files, not esps, and it creates way more references than it needs to when mods are packaged as esps.   In theory, one could turn all one's esm files into esps (which the author of PTP apparently does), but a huge benefit can be gained by only converting the mods with the biggest reference counts.   In my game, those are as follows:
	
	Capital Whiterun Expansion 1.5 - KZ esmified esp replacer
	Capital Windhelm Expansion 1.3 - KZ esmified esp replacer
	Clockwork (SSE) 1.0 - KZ esmified esp replacer
	Darkend 1.4 - KZ esmified esp replacer
	Depths of the Reach 1.8 - aka Darkstorm - KZ esmified esp replacer
	Dungeons - Revisited 1.1.1 - KZ esmified esp replacer
	Following Mercer 1.0 - KZ esmified esp replacer
	Identity Crisis 1.04 - KZ esmified esp replacer
	Lucien v1.6.3 - KZ esmified esp replacer
	Obscure's College of Winterhold 1.6.1 - aka OCW - KZ esmified esp replacer
	Relighting Skyrim 2.1.0 - full with USSEP - KZ esmified esp replacer
	Rigmor of Bruma - Reboot v1.1c - KZ esmified esp replacer
	Skeever 1.3.7 - aka GA88 - KZ esmified esp replacer
	Skyrim Sewers 4.15 - KZ esmified esp replacer
	The Forgotten City v1.8 - KZ esmified esp replacer
	The Tools of Kagrenac V1.59 SSE - KZ esmified esp replacer
	The Wheel of Time 2.02 - KZ esmified esp replacer
	Wanderer's Heart 1.5 - KZ esmified esp replacer
	
	Doing just these 18 reduced my refcount usage from 730K to under 483K.  If I esmified everything, I could get near 200K, but I feel comfy being anywhere under 500K.
	
	Needs lots of looking in xEdit to check for conficts from new load order.

	- This should be loaded lower then Open Animations Romance and Erotica as it has to overwrite certain XMLs from that mod. This mod should not conflict with the opensex compatability patch at all if you mean this one here [OpenSex Compatibility Patch - Addon Hub version]
	- Included Anal Animations - AceAnalMissionary and Climax - AceAnalCowgirl

	OpenSex Compatibility Patch - Addon Hub version 6.0 Kwynon---VersuchDrei
	https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/82525
	This mod adds compatibility between OpenSex Addon Hub, Billyy Lesbian Animation pack for OStim, Billyy Threesome Animation Pack for OStim, Nibbles Animatiion pack for OStim, Billy Lesbian 3P Animation Pack and OSex L'Amour Rose Animation pack either with or without OStim Feet Animation pack.
	- As of version 2.0 the OpenSex Addon Hub is incompatible with the old OpenSex Compatibility Patch (oh the irony), because they both hook into the standing intro scene. This could be solved by simply updating the Compatibility Patch to also support the addon hub. But that would mean that whenever Ace makes changes to the scene in OpenSex we now had to update two mods to reflect those.
	- And, frankly, I have better things to do with my time than update a bunch of mods to keep up with OpenSex weekly updates, so I try to keep the workload of that at a minimum, which is why this version of the Compatibility Patch now hooks into a Compatibility Patch Hub in the OpenSex Addon Hub instead of the OpenSex intro scene directly. That way this Compatibility Patch no longer has to worry about upwards compatibility, as that burden now solely lies on the Addon Hubs shoulders.
	- For a recommended load order refer to the OpenSex Addon Hub modpage.
	- Note: This patch is designed for old legacy animation packs. If you are creating a new animation pack and don't know how to connect it to the OpenSex scene graph ask for a hub to be added to the OpenSex Addon Hub.

	Heels Fix 1.6.2
	https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/64442
	Replacement/upgrade for Racemenu High Heels(Height Fixes). Provides advanced positioning correction when wearing high heels.
	- This mod provides 'smart' correction when a high heel wearer interacts with furniture or other markers. 
		It is a replacement/upgrade for the well-known  Racemenu High Heels (Height Fixes) mod by ousnius,  (RacemenuHH)
	- 	Racemenu ﻿handles high heels by permanently elevating an actor above ground by an offset value provided in the shoes' mesh file.   As a result, actor also floats over chairs, beds, and other furniture.   Which looks rather jarring and weird.
	- To correct this, RacemenuHH is the most known option, but it is pretty basic.   All it does is cancel heel offset whenever an actor interacts with some furniture, swims or mounts a horse.   This causes their feet to sink into ground, but at least the rest is aligned.  
	- One great alternative to RacemenuHH is the Misc High Heels Sitting Height Fix mod (MiscHH), but it is an SKSE plugin.  As many know, when Skyrim Anniversary Edition (AE) was released in late 2021, it broke old SKSE plugins.  Meaning those whose authors have left the modding scene, are now obsolete.
	- If you have not updated and still use Skyrim SE 1.5.97 or earlier, that mod should still work for you.  But  If you updated to AE (1.6.*), you definitely want to check out this one.
	- Out of the box, this mod is disabled.   You need to go into its MCM and enable what you need.

	FOMOD: whatever it selects.  REINSTALL after installing CRF or ICAIO
	- Compatibility
	- This mod has USSEP edits baked into it except for one script involving delivering dwarven artifacts to Calcelmo. I believe it's just a simple exploit fix, I've added an optional patch file but your game will be just fine without it.
	- I know that Immersive Speech Dialogues﻿, Better Intimidation﻿, Dark Brotherhood for Good Guys, Thieves Guild for Good Guys, and BA Gold to Septims Dialogue﻿ are incompatible because they change vanilla dialogue. I can make a patch for these if people want to barring ISD and BI.
	- More Dialogue Options, and Guard Dialogue Overhaul SE, and Sensible Bribes is compatible and highly reccomended. You will have to load my mod AFTER these mods.
	- The newest update (1.4.2) has a FOMOD with patches for Unofficial Skyrim Special Edition Patch, Relationship Dialogue Overhaul, Alternate Start, Bring Meeko to Lod, A Lovely Letter Alternate Routes, Misc Dialogue Edits, Immersive Citizens - AI Overhaul, Thieves Guild for Good Guys, and Favor Quests Separated.

NEW MODS - PATCHES
	These patches are not original, they are extractions from ZedPatch and ZedPatch2 to reduce those mega-patch's sets of required masters.  Specifically, I'm doing this so that I can more easily switch mods and their patches in and out at the esp or mod level, without having to go in and edit the zed patches.  This will also make it easier to eslify certain mods in the future.  I'm running into Out of Memory errors in xEdit when try to do conflict resolution on my whole load order all at once, so I'm going to experiment with going CR while omitting a lot of the big 'new worldspace' mods, with have lotsa records but very few conflicts.

	Ironback Hideout - Slaver's Edition 1.2
	https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/26645-ironback-hideout-slavers-edition/
	A complete remake of the Ironback Hideout Player Home mod originally by Jokerine. The original was for Oldrim (this one is for SSE) and has open permission to use it however as long as Jokerine is credited as the original author. I ported it to Special Edition and rebuilt almost everything. The cellar is approximately x4.5 larger than the original and has a whole lot more features (such as a couple of jail cells with doors operated by levers on a nearby wall). Made it for my own PAHE/DoM playthroughs and decided to share it since I'm happy with the way it turned out.
	
	Simple Slave Cellars 1.0.0
	https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/27226-simple-slave-cellars/
	- This mod currently adds a cellar underneath of Breezehome, and a cellar underneath of Honeyside - both set up to store slaves/prisoners/whoever the hell you want to keep in them. The goal is to eventually add one to every one of the base game player homes and possibly to Severin Manor as well. Right now though, it's just Breezehome and Honeyside.
	
	Hearthfire Menageries 1.0.0
	https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/27227-hearthfire-menageries/
	-Adds a place to keep slaves/prisoners/whoever the hell you want to the cellars of the three Hearthfire houses. Like my Simple Slave Cellars mod, the new hearthfire additions add 4 small cells, 2 larger cells, a master bedroom, and a guest room. They each also have a bathhouse/pool area. 
	- incompt CC Fishing
	- DO NOT INSTALL
	
	Hearthfire Baths Reborn 1.0.0
	https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/27228-hearthfire-baths-reborn/
	- Inspired by the "Baths for Hearthfire Homes Redone" mod. I liked the architecture of those bathhouses, but they had a few issues that were deal-breakers for me. Since that mod has two authors, instead of asking them both if I can redo their mod and fix a few things to my liking - I chose to create my own.
	- Unlike the original, mine are Nav-Meshed so you can bring followers down there.

	Brynjolf and the Riften Guild - Birthright 2.5
	https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/81471
	You’re a Nightingale, and it’s time to clean house! Brynjolf must have time for you now, and surely you can help Rune with his hopeless search for his origins. This is a huge quest mod, fully voiced by both original characters and beloved NPC’s, with thousands of lines of dialogue, four dungeons and a romantic character arc for a certain ging
	- compatibility notes - in Hearthfile Multi-Kid, avoid custom name though! It appears to conflict.
	- recommended: Honeyside Thane of Riften.  I designed this version of Honeyside to play well with this mod. Use it or any Honeyside that keeps the vanilla Player bed, otherwise Bryn won't be able to find his side of the bed.
	-The Thieves Guild quest line ended in a cliff-hanger: Brynjolf won’t talk to you and Rune remains an orphan to his past. This mod extends the story line in a completely immersive way, with an adventure that will lead you through Forsworn crypts and Dwemer ruins, to the very roots of Yddrasil to aid your brothers in crime. Fully voiced, by both original characters and beloved NPC’s, this enormous quest mod adds thousands of lines of dialogue, four dungeons and an actual romantic character arc for a certain infuriating Red-head. (Brynjolf himself had 2000+ original lines, and yes if you're crazy enough, you can marry him, but only on his terms of course!)
	- Important! This is a stand-alone mod.  Please do not use it with "Brynjolf has time for you"! This new mod contains all the parts of the earlier version.
	- To begin: You must complete Darkness Returns (return the Skeleton key and choose your Nightingale skill)
		Read and pocket your red leather journal left on a shelf by the Cistern Ladder entrance
		Then speak to Brynjolf, and he will no longer "have important things to do". He'll answer two questions which starts the lines of his quests.
		After that, he will follow you, if asked.

	DL: Encounter Zones Unlocked SE 1.4 10 mar 2020  - For Skyrim <= 1.5.97
	Configuration (not required)
		The following options can be configured in Data\SKSE\Plugins\encounter_zones_unlocked.ini:
		Allow visited dungeons to level with the player. The main purpose of the mod.
		 DisableLevelLocking = 1
		You can also activate these changes to Encounter Zones. If you are not certain what they do, just keep them disabled.
		The changes override (for disable min/max) or stack with (for scaling) changes from other Encounter Zone mods like PermaZONE or Higher Difficulty:
		 DisableMinLevel = 0 Set to 1 to remove the minimum level.
		 DisableMaxLevel = 0 Set to 1 to remove the maximum level (most Zones don't have one).
		 ScaleMinLevel = 1.0 Scale the minimum level by this factor (values < 1.0 are ignored). Only works if DisableMinLevel is not active.
		 ScaleMaxLevel = 1.0 Scale the maximum level by this factor (values < 1.0 are ignored). Only works if DisableMaxLevel is not active.
		 ScaleZjavascript-event-stripped 1.0 Scale the zone level relative to the player level.
	
	Incognito 1.0
	https://www.afkmods.com/index.php?/files/file/2141-incognito/  (removed from Nexus, along with other Arthmoor mods)
	A simple mod to remove all crime bounties when you change your face using the NPC in the Ragged Flagon.
	So. You've changed your identity. How is it that the guards in each hold still know exactly who you are when you (in theory) don't even look the same anymore? Well now they won't. After having your face changed, crime bounties in every hold will be removed. You're on your honor though, since the script can't tell how extensive a change you make to your face.

	You become invisible in front of people and no one bats an eye... Well, no more! With almost 300+ custom voiced reactions, NPCs will now react to both someone disappearing and someone materializing in front of them. Immersion!
	DL: main 1.0 28 may 2023
	
	Carriages and Stables Dialogue Bundle 1.0 by jayserpa
	https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/79297
	A couple of small mods, bundled up in one. Carriage drivers will randomly comment on the weather, their day, etc. as you walk by. Also, horse armor dialogue is now voiced with generic responses instead of silent lines, which also fixes the (...) bug if you're having it. No CC requirements.
	DL: main 1.0 24 nov 2022
		Carriage and Ferry Travel Overhaul Patch 1.0 09 dec 2022

	Chico the Comedy Khajiit Voiced NPC 1.0

	Water Douses Fire v2
	https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/34344
	Jump into the water to douse yourself when set on fire by spells or dragons. Makes sense, right?
	- While fighting dragons I found myself wanting to jump into the water to keep myself from being burned alive, only to find out it has no effect. I don't care if it's magic, Water Douses Fire! You need quick reflexes to take advantage of this because fire effects usually don't last long (~1-2 secs). You also need to be fully submerged seeing as your whole body is on fire. The plugin is flagged as an ESL so it won't take up precious slots in your load order!
	- COMPATIBILITY: Compatible with all fire magic effects that use the MagicDamageFire keyword as they should.

	Unbroken Records 0.5.2
	https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/50777
	Stops incessant pestering by shop owners and tones down repetitive scenes between NPCs.
	DL: main 0.5.2 05 jul 2021 - Main file, always needed. USSEP fixes forwarded. ESP-FE.
		Unbroken Records Patch - RDO (or RDO Lite) 28 jun 2021
	- This mod is meant to complement Relaxed Vendors by tarlazo, and therefore does NOT include changes from that mod (outdoor vendors). I highly recommend them to be used together.
	
	Relaxed Vendors 1.0.2
	https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30509
	Less frequent street vendor calls. MCM and normal versions. ESP-FE
	DL:
	- The MCM version allows to configure and randomize the dialogue frequency, but requires SkyUI. To [hopefully] better explain: you set a "no-skip chance" in the MCM -- whenever the vendor tries to say the line, a random percentage is calculated. If the result is less than the "no-skip chance", the vendor speaks -- if not, the vendor shuts up.
	- Compatible with "Relationship Dialogue Overhaul" -- load it after RDO or it won't work.

RADAR:
	Improved Camera
	https://www.reddit.com/r/skyrimmods/comments/cae3x2/mod_improved_camera_beta_3/
	Improved Camera is a mod built from reverse engineering of Skyrim - Enhanced Camera (LE), with the purpose to bring the same functionality to SE.
	Now in beta, and works in 1.5.39, 1.5.62, 1.5.73, and "probably" all versions in between, with the same dll. It "may" work in future updates, too. In the eventuality that it doesn't work, you would get an error message, either at early game startup, at first save load, or at first person enter.
	The mod has been rebranded as "Improved Camera" (as to not use the same name than the original from Oldrim, which is from a different author). The source code is now released (it may be a bit cryptic still, be warned). If you are a developer and want to compile it, read the readme.txt there before.
	Link: Improved Camera 1.0 (Beta 4)Link: Improved Camera 1.0 (Beta 3)
	Default settings (ImprovedCamera.ini) are always going to be subjective and not to everyone's taste but tried to cater to the vast playerbase.
	- bFix360Animations: set this to 1 if you use 360 Walk and Run Plus AND YY Animations SSE its not an ideal fix but shall be improved upon.
	- bScriptedIdleAnimMatchHeadRotation=1: Enabled by default now to solve various animation issues however sometimes it can cause actor(s) to disappear due to clipping. (Depends how close you are to various objects/walls before triggering)
	- bEnableHeadXXX: Defaulted to 1 for everything barring bEnableHeadFirstPersonScripted (note above fix). Not going to have head shadows if you are shrinking it. :/
	- bEnableHeadBobPositionXXX: Defaulted to 1 for everything apart from rolling. More than likely need to adjust CameraPosY and CameraPosZ offsets if you disable any of these to compensate.
	- XXXCameraPosX/Y/Z: Have all been adjusted for a better vanilla experience.
	- bUseThirdPersonArms and Bow: Defaulted to 1 to create shadows. Some combat may feel abit weird just disable it in the ini file if you don't like it.
	- If wondering why not release it on Nexus (dumbass), need to fix the top two issues below and completely rewrite it for sanity.
	- Known Issue(s):
	- Some animations can cause the camera to break (Animated Eating Redux SE editon, Keep it Clean - A Bathing Mod) if viewed in First Person.
	- Camera requires to press F key (default Toggle Third/First Person) for Horse/Dragon Riding although this doesn't work whilst sitting. (Can break Go to bed if toggling POV's)
	- Fix clipping issues, need someone experienced with Creation Engine as it can be potentially erradicated. (Dynamically adjusted)
	- Camera can go wonky opening the Tab Menu whilst on horse back. (rarely happens)
	- bFirstPersonShadows is broken. (always on)
	- Uninstalling Joy of Perspective may not be not enough: Read here. Big thanks to Curmudgeon1542 for this solution.
	- Workaround for animations breaking, use another object (seat, bed or something) or enter another cell. Usually corrects itself. Or as Moravia300 mentioned.
	- KZ Notes: this beta is 4 years old now; it's not going to get updated.  I had CTD on start when installed.

	Environs - Master Plugin 1.0 by Siberpunk
	https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/91160
	Master plugin required by several mods in the Environs series.
	- This plugin is necessary is to avoid several engine-level bugs that can occur with ESL-flagged mods when they add new interiors. This plugin allows the Environs mods to be ESL-flagged while safely avoiding these bugs. 
	- It’s been found that interior cells can break when they’re defined in ESL-flagged plugins and have other plugins edit them (such as patches), causing objects in the cell to disappear. In addition, wSkeever has documented another bug on his post here, relating to saving and object persistence, which also seems to pertain to ESL-flagged mods that add new cells.
	- This plugin solves these issues by creating new empty cells which can then be modified safely by ESL-flagged plugins. On a side note, the Update.esm actually does this for several Creation Club add-ons. 
	
MAJOR BUG ALERT!!!!
	Skyrim Bug PSA - why you probably shouldn't reload saves while playing
	https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/videos/21592
	Happens on Vanilla Skyrim (with only the test mod installed)
	Exiting to main menu is not enough
	Reload on death is the exact same
	Edit: I did some more testing after reading some reddit comments talking about plugin flags:
	Removing ESL flag from the plugin fixes the issue. There was a previously known bug with ESL flags that prevents other plugins from editing cells defined in ESL plugins, but this seems like another bug that happens even if nothing else edits the cell.
	ESL + ESM flag does not fix the issue
	This at least explains this specific save loading issue.
	TL;DR - Never reload a slave in game!  Always start over before reloading for absolute safety!
		*PROBABLY* it's safe to reload if not in a cell defined in an ESL
	****NEVER EVER EVER**** ESLify a mod that defines new cells.
	- trick for eslifying mods with new cells - create a esm that defines the cell, change esp, then eslify

	Updated: Feb 12
	- Q: How is this armor pack any different?
	- A: I will be honest, this is the best version of the armor for Skyrim Special Edition. I took extra care to edit the sliders for all armor pieces so that they look good with 95% of body presets. The original LE version was full of inconsistencies and dirty edits you won't believe it. The one for Special Edition on Nexus is just straight garbage. In addition, cleaned up A LOT of records in the ESP, added heels sound support, added support SOS, etc.
	- A: The armor pack supports the following bodies:

INSTALL UPDATE:
	Vanilla Scripting Enhancements 3.0
	https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/68139
	Optimize certain vanilla scripts with PO3 Extender to reduce script lag when using lots of mods.
	DL: BSA Version 3.0 29 may 2023 (we don't want to overwrite mod-added scripts in bsas)
	- The Problem:
		Honestly, if your playing the vanilla game with a small amount of mods, you probably don't need this. If you use a lot of mods, particularly mods that have invisible cloak spells (Vokrii, Adamant, Footprints, etc.) you may notice that certain NPCs' presence (Saadia, Nirya, Alduin, etc.) gives you script lag.
		This is because those mods use cloak spells to distribute their stuff to all the NPCs around you (or to you the player from those NPCs) so that their mod can work properly. You may notice that fire/frost/storm cloaks do damage to an NPC every second or so? Imagine that, but an invisible cloak that covers an entire cell (it's pretty big). 1 or 2 cloak spells won't be particularly noticeable on your script performance, but several of those cloak spells from those mods can bring the script engine to its knees (see screenshot of what my 900+ mod list does to the game)
		Normally, 50 cloak spells doesn't do anything on its own to stress the script engine. But, some NPCs have scripts attached to them that listen for a particular event: `OnMagicEffectApply`. All these cloak spells are repeatably triggering this event and forcing the Papyrus engine to do tons of unnecessary work.
		Edit: The problem this mod aims to fix is script lag. This is not something you will notice directly like with FPS lag, but something that can be noticed indirectly (Ex: interaction takes 5+ seconds to do, activating an ability takes a few seconds to actually do the thing, just things having a delay before doing what they are supposed do, if they even do anything at all), or if you use SSE Display Tweaks (https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/34705) you can see it in the OSD as "VM Overstressing"
	Our Solution:
		This mod aims to mitigate that by using PO3's `OnMagicEffectApplyEx` event. Unlike the vanilla one, `OnMagicEffectApplyEx` only fires for what you register it for.
		For example, `MG01NiryaScript` is attached to Nirya from the college, and responds to `OnMagicEffectApply` by checking if you are healing her with Healing Hands. In vanilla, that event will fire for every single effect (especially those cloak spells) and check if it was healing hands. With `OnMagicEffectApplyEx`, it will now only fire if she was hit with Healing Hands, significantly reducing the amount of work the script engine has to do for her.

	Markarth - Help the Warrens and A Cure for Cairine SE 1.1

	Skyrim is a harsh place, but few places are as depressing as the Warrens of Markarth. Have you ever wished you could help? Now you can!	This is a SE port of a wonderful mod by DaedricSaber1701 to help repair the Warrens in Markarth.
	DL: main 1.1 01 feb 2021
	Compat:  mild incompat with Thieves Guild for Good Guys.  Probably safe, but I've been told that it includes a side quest to cure Cairine; that could be a problem. For now, I would advise doing just one quest to cure Cairine (either MHW's or Good Guys'), and make sure whichever mod you want to take precedence is loaded last (e.g. if you want to MHW's cairine quest, make sure MHW is loaded after Good Guys). Hopefully that will be sufficient to get the two mods to play nice. If anyone has tested these two mods together, it would be great if you could post your experience in the comments.

	This mod adds a carriage to Helgen Reborn from CFTO via a small quest as well as adding Helgen as a travel destination via all other carriages (With local prices and regional prices) as well as the hearthfire carriages
	- Bugs I can not fix or don't know how to fix
	- The sitting animation in the carriage backseat for the Helgen carriage is a little off sided. It doesn't effect functionality, its purely cosmetic. Same thing in a way for the Helgen Carriage Driver (Hes floating a bit from the seat but again doesn't effect functionality)
	- Helgen travel option will be available from the start of the game so you could in theory travel there via carriage when the bandits are occupying Helgen. I tried to condition it via a Helgen Reborn quest but it would stop the main option showing for the none local carriages if you hadn't got to the specific quest stage. If anyone knows a way to fix this, I'm all ears. I will even credit you :)

	- There's a house added to the outskirts of Falkreath by Helgen Reborn. If you use The Great City of Falkreath, you'll notice that this house is right in the middle of the new Falkreath wall. Now it's not.
	- I also fixed some weird navmesh problems caused by loading both mods together.

	Keeps you from having to close and re-enter the game after Helgen.
	https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/79479
	If you use TrueHUD with Alternate Perspective, you may notice that the HUD disappears when Alduin attacks during the destruction of Helgen (right before the Title Sequence appears) and does not return after you enter Helgen Keep. To restore it you have to restart the game. This was annoying me and increasing the support burden of my modlist, Licentia BLACK, so I simply commented out the portion of the script that hides the HUD. You will still see the health and magicka widget during the Title Sequence, but at least you won't have to restart the game.

	No Naked Comments Available Here
	https://migal3d.com/no-naked-comments-here/
	This is yet another one of my mods removed from Nexus after they warned us they were about to claim perpetual distribution rights to our work.  I’ve now made it available here on Migal3D.
	It is extremely simple.  It keeps NPCs from complaining about you not wearing clothes.

	Smaller Women Now Available Here
	https://migal3d.com/uncategorized/smaller-women-now-available-here/
	https://migal3d.com/smaller-women/
	This mod causes women in Skyrim to be shorter.  Its primary purpose is to keep females with heels from towering above males.  No scripts.  It simply modifies vanilla race records.  I also went ahead and fixed the female orc walk so it is feminine, so you don’t need another mod for that.
	Requirements:  Skyrim SE
	Q:  Will this conflict with other mods that alter the vanilla races?
	A:  Yes.  This mod alters vanilla races.  You cannot successfully run two mods that alter vanilla races.  If you’re using a mod that intentionally alters only some of the vanilla races, you should place this mod above it in your load order so the other mod can overrule.  Otherwise, place this mod as low as you can, because many custom follower makers alter a vanilla race when they make their character.
	Q:  USSEP compatible?
	A:  Yes.
	Q:  Will this also make custom follower and NPC females shorter?
	A:  Mostly.  Some custom followers and NPCs come with their own races so they can use a custom fighting style or mix racial characteristics.  This mod cannot affect custom races.
	Q:  What about female children?
	A:  Children have their own race and are thus unchanged.
	Q:  Is this safe to install mid-game?
	A:  Yes, with caveats.  It will work, but possibly not completely.  NPC height is saved in the game’s cache.  If you save your game in a building with females, or the last two cells you were in had females, installing this mod may not change the height of those females, because they are cached in your game save.  Furthermore, if they were using furniture, especially bartenders, the furniture rescales them to fit.  They could end up somewhere between what this mod wants to do and what the furniture was already doing.  You can resolve it by opening the console, clicking on the NPC, and issuing the command:  SetScale 1.0
	Q:  How do I get around the mid-game issues above?
	A:  Take your character out into the wilderness, with no females in the prior three cells you explored.  Save your game there, then install this mod.  Or, install when starting a new game and never worry about it.
	Q:  Is it safe to uninstall mid-game?
	A:  Any mod that alters NPC weight or height runs the risk of leaving some of the changes to NPCs cached inside game saves.  It is the nature of the beast.  Uninstalling won’t break your game, but you might not see every female go back to their vanilla height until a new play-through.
	Q:  Furniture problems?
	A:  No, the game looks at a character’s current scale and changes it to fit the furniture.
	Q:  Can this cause some female NPC bartenders to not quite get their hands on top of the bar?
	A:  Yes, if the female NPC was already on the short side and if that female is cached in your game save, bartenders can seem a little too short for their bar counters after installing this mod, unless you start a new game.  Other furniture will be fine.  I don’t personally care because I’m sick of females in heels being taller than my male Nord character.
	Q:  Will this conflict with paired animation mods that require the animated characters to be a specific height, such as Flower Girls or OStim?
	A:  No.
	Q:  Some of the females are really friggin’ short!
	A:  Some custom NPCs have their height reduced in their NPC records.  The size of an NPC is determined by a combination of the NPC record and the race record.  So, a custom NPC with a very short NPC record will be even shorter.  However, they shouldn’t be insanely short.  The shortest female is likely to be approximately 85 percent of the height of a Nord male.
	Q:  Load order?
	A:  Lower is better.

	This mod adds a medium sized vampire castle to Skyrim and various screenshot locations (accessible via the carriage in the court or the location access room). It is located in north west of Solitude. 
	Even though normal house usage and gameplay is possible, it is intended for taking screenshots. 
	- Are you a millennia old vampire and tired of living in Harkon's dreg heap of a castle? Are you looking for class and luxury and a place to live your devious, bloody vampire fantasies? 
	Fortunately Baroness Nora Karlov had to leave Skyrim on urgent business of the realm, and she was kind enough to grant you living rights in Karlov Manor during her absent. 
	This mod adds a medium size manor to Skyrim. It is kept in a dark fantasy baroque style fitting for a vampire character or similar. The castle is located west of Solitude lighthouse, or accessible via the console ("coc ACCastleEx").
	The manor features a large living area with various rooms. In an underground area you'll find thrall dungeons for your bloody needs, as well as crafting areas. Furthermore, this mod adds a gothic church/chapel dedicated to Molag Bal. Besides the mod adds various locations I used in my story blog "Of Blood and Pleasure" accessible via the main hall and a secret area.

However, unlike common Crows, Ravens prefer rural, less urbanized regions, being more often seen in villages and farms, rather than densely populated cities. Therefore, they are a more common sighting in southern Skyrim.

	- I recommend pairing this mod with Player Rotation in ShowRaceMenu which makes it easy to inspect changes from different angles.

	Legend of 1001 Nights De-Standalone 2.0
	https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/91202?tab=files
	This mod edits the legendary Shiri follower by triptherift to allow for the use of your own body and textures. Also flagged ESPFE.
	- The original mod by triptherift had a custom body and textures. This mod will allow you to use your own body and textures when installed over the original mod. It is also flagged ESPFE. In my testing, you will get good results if you use BnP - Female Skin. 
	- One thing to note is that the original outfit does not have Bodyslide files so it will take the shape of the original body. There is nothing I can do about that. If you remove the outfit, it will have your chosen body or you can adjust the body with a mod like OBody NG - OStim and Standalone Version and give them an outfit of your choosing that does have Bodyslide capabilities.

	RaceMenu 0.4.16 Memory Leak Hotfix (SE) 1.0
	https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/70161
	Fixes a severe memory leak issue in RaceMenu 0.4.16 (SE 1.5.97)
	- Fixes a severe memory leak issue in RaceMenu 0.4.16 (SE 1.5.97) skee64 binary that prevents memory allocated for armors and inventory objects from being freed. This can lead to poor performance and finally cause a crash due to the system running out of memory. The issue is present in RaceMenu versions from 0.4.10 to 0.4.19.9.1, possibly older ones too.
	- This does not contain code or any other assets from expired6978's RaceMenu and will not do anything by itself. It works by injecting additional code that handles cleanup into skee64.dll at runtime.
	- The patch only works on SE (runtime 1.5.97) and RM 0.4.16 using pattern matching to validate the skee64 binary. It won't do anything for any other version.

INSTALL:
	DLL Plugin Loader 1.0
	https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/10546
	Simple DLL plugins loader.
	How to install:
		1. Go to your Skyrim Special Edition root directory. This is the same folder where SkyrimSE.exe is, usually "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Skyrim Special Edition\"
		2. Rename "binkw64.dll" to "binkw64_.dll" <- now there's a _ at the end.
		3. Put the "binkw64.dll" from downloaded archive into the folder mentioned in step 1.
		4. If you did it correctly you should have two files in your folder now: "binkw64.dll" and "binkw64_.dll", that's all, you can start the game now.
	How to check if everything is working correctly:
		1. Go to where you installed "binkw64.dll" (SkyrimSE.exe folder)
		2. Create a new file if it does not exist called "binkw64.log", make sure the extension says "log" and not "txt"!
		3. Start game and then exit game, it's fine if you only entered to main menu, no need to load into any save game.
		4. Now open the "binkw64.log" file, it will say what plugins if any were checked and whether they loaded correctly.
		5. If the file is empty then no plugins were found! This could indicate a problem with permissions or the folder path "Data\DLLPlugins" does not exist.

	SSE Fixes 3.1.5.97
	https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/10547?tab=files
	Fix for a bug in Skyrim Special Edition that causes low fps.
	- requires DLL Plugin Loader
	- There is a bug in game code where if you have more than a few dozen ESP or ESM plugins installed the game FPS will become much lower in some areas. The ESP or ESM file content does not matter at all they can be empty dummy plugins with no masters. This happens because there are at least 4 nested iteration loops the game does in every frame and the lowest loop iterates for each plugin installed, normally this wouldn't be an issue but this code runs on multiple threads and for each plugin it locks a mutex every time, this is very slow. It's not even really a bug, just bad implementation.
	
	Animation Limit Crash Fix SSE 0.3-beta
	https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/31146
	The patch fixes the crash on game loading when you install too many animations with FNIS. The one mentioned in the article by Fore.  May also give you increased fps and loading speed by skipping a redundant part of code. More technical information you can find in the Developers section below.
	Incompatibility - SSE Engine Fixes - the option AnimationLoadSignedCrash must be disabled in the EngineFixes.toml (EngineFixes.ini in old versions) file to make it work together with the patch.

TESTING
	

DISABLE MOD:
	Karlov Manor
		- looks gorgeous, but DynDOLOD says it's missing tons of meshes and textures, and it's not really usable as a home - it's a photoshoot set.  no npcs to interact with.  regretfully will be removing it, to free up the esp slot.

SYNTHESIS
	Not usable.  Z fix does not look at last winning record, if *any* mod has bad Z, it forwards that mod, not later overrides that may re-enable it and fix the Z.

	This is a mod that made the difference between idle animations in combat and non-combat situations even when holding a weapon.
	- In Skyrim, whenever you pull out a weapon, you are always ready to fight.
	- However, this mode separates the idle animation from combat and non-combat situations when the weapon is taken out.
	- when an enemy is detected and enters a battle situation, an idle animation for each weapon is displayed according to the battle situation.
	- If the enemy disappears or dies and becomes a non-combat situation, it switches back to the non-combat idle animation.
	- requires Disable Turn Animation
	- uses Nemesis "Turning Animation Won't Affect Upper Body" feature
	- overwrites animated armory

	First Person Animation Teleport Bug Fix 1.0 Monitor144Hz
	https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/92795
	Behavior patch that fixes a vanilla bug where starting certain interaction animations in first person teleports you to the start of the cell you were in. Clean, compatible, and lightweight.
	- When playing vanilla interaction animations while in first person, there is an annoying bug where the player gets teleported to the beginning of the cell point after their hand glitches out on the screen.
	- This mod fixes that teleport bug while ensuring the animations play as normal in third person, without any scripts or workarounds.
	- It simply just prevents the transitions from ever happening in the first place when the player is in 1st person view. It does not touch 3rd person animations at all, and it consists of a tiny Nemesis patch that should be compatible with every other behavior edit out there.
	- Highly recommended when using a mod like JaySerpa's Immersive Interactions, which uses a lot of interaction animations. 
	- Install: 1. Install mod. 2. Run Nemesis, tick patch for mod, update engine, launch. 3. Done!

	C.O.I.N. - Coins of Interesting Natures 2.1.1.2  Tate Taylor and VictorF
	https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/51439

	C.O.I.N. - Merchant Exchange 2.1.0
	https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/70644
	C.O.I.N. is a fantastic mod by TateTaylorOH and VictorF. This mod allows you to exchange your coins from C.O.I.N. at general goods merchants instead of auto converting the coins.
	- Updated merchant exchange to be compatible with C.O.I.N. 2.1.0+
	- DO NOT USE THIS VERSION WITH AN OLDER VERSION OF COIN
	- The concept of finding other coins besides Septims in dungeons is something that makes the world feel much more grounded and realistic.
	One of the neat features of C.O.I.N. is that it serves as a lite economy mod. Each coin has a different value relative to a Septim. C.O.I.N. achieves this by auto converting the coin you pick up into its worth of Septims. This is a really creative way to put a dent into the amount of gold you retrieve from dungeons.
	- However, there are many times I wish I could pick up and keep the coin itself. Particularly when playing a character that likes to collect artifacts or other items.
	- ﻿Therefore, this mod makes the following changes to C.O.I.N.
	- Ask general goods traders to exchange your alternative coins for gold. Picking up a coin will no longer auto convert it to Septims. 
	- If you have any of the coins on your character the option to exchange them will be available for selection. The merchant will take all of your selected coins, and give you the appropriate amount of Septims.
	- The appropriate amount of gold with be deducted from the vendor's available gold.
	- If the vendor does not have enough gold, they will only take the coins from you that they can afford.

	Adds weight (0.01) to Septims and all the coins from C.O.I.N. - Coins of Interesting Natures
	- will undoubtedly need patches.  weight is accurate, as i consider 1 weight to be about 1/3 lb, so this is 300 coins per pound

	College of Winterhold Entry Requirements 3.2
	https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/24749
	Adds customizable skill level requirements to join the College of Winterhold.
	- This mod adds requirements to joining the College of Winterhold. It is fully voiced because Bethesda planned to have requirements to join the College at one point and recorded lines for being rejected. Also, when Faralda tests your magical prowess, she will test you on your highest eligible skill instead of randomly selecting one of the schools of magic. Like in Vanilla, you can still bypass the test with persuasion, or by showing Faralda that you are Dragonborn. In fact, the latter option has been changed to be available as soon as you unlock shouts, instead of only after the point when the main quest prompts you to go to the College.
	- As Bethesda originally planned, joining the College requires an "Apprentice"-level magic perk. This mod also adds an alternative requirement so that simply having a skill level of 25 will substitute for having the perk. The specific skill level can be customized or disabled using the MCM.

	True Hunter - fewer animals per square meter 5.0
	https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/25628
	Reduces the number of leveled animals with customizable spawn chances. No more predators at every turn.
	- Adds more realism, interest and challenge to hunting and makes traveling less annoying by decreasing the number of animals. It's done by adding a chance of disabling for each animal on cell loading, the chances are set separately for predators, "prey" and "ambient creatures". It's not how things are supposed to work in this game, just a workaround for maximum compatibility.
	- This mod only affects leveled NPCs, which means that completely predefined animals (such as wolves near Riverwood) won't be affected. They are not included to minimize mod conflicts. I also excluded animals that are in some location, i.e. not just in wilderness.
	-  Default spawn chances (100% in vanilla):
		Predators - 12% (wolves, sabrecats, skeevers, bears, spiders, trolls, etc.)
		"Prey" - 45% (deer, goat)
		"Ambient creatures" -  20% (fox, rabbit)
	- I also changed the ratio between foxes and rabbits from 3:2 to 1:5.
	- The small chance is justified by a really lot of spawn points in the world. You can customize the chances with the optional MCM or via xEdit.
	- There are two versions of the mod: with and without a MCM. The MCM allows you to change the spawn chances (but they can be changed even in the No MCM version via global variables). The MCM settings are shared by all saved games if you have PapyrusUtil installed, but it's not required.
	- COMPATIBILITY
		Conflicts with other mods that edit LvlPredatorScript.
		Place True Hunter before Animallica and Seasonal Wildlife Distribution.
		Place True Hunter after Requiem.
		Compatible with unleveling mods, SkyTEST, Wild World, No Predators on roads, Certainly Less Annoying
		Wildlife Spawns - CLAWS, Dynamic Animal Variants, Predator Animals Randomized Spawning.
		Only because of possible conflicts in the leveled list with foxes and rabbits, place the plugin before all mods that add new animals, letting them to ovewrite this edit if necessary.
		It doesn't edit every spawn point but affects all at once by changing their "base", so it is compatible with everything that adds, moves or removes them.
		It only affects vanilla animal types so you need a patch if you want it to work with mods that don't use vanilla leveled lists to spawn their animals.
	
	Customizable Companions Questline Progression Requirements 1.1 by lilebonymace  INSTALL
	https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/78308
	Increases and allows to customize the number of radiant quests required for advancing in the Companions questline.
	- In vanilla you need to complete one radiant quest before you can start Proving Honor, one before The Silver Hand and two before Blood's Honor, making pauses in the questline. This mod allows you to increase the duration of the questline by increasing the number of radiant quests required for its progression.
	- This mod does the same thing as The Companions - Earn your stripes and More Radiant Quests for the Companions, but they require patches for aMidianBorn Skyforge Weapons/Content Addon/Armor Variants Lite and any other mods that edit the Take Up Arms quest record. Moreover, a separate patch needs to be made for each of the provided options. My mod doesn't any vanilla records or scripts and therefore is compatible with everything, and also doesn't limit you to a few options.
	- The installer includes presets matching the mentioned mods. If you're not satisfied with the presets, you can easily set the desired number of radiant quests required for each of the three quests in a .json file that comes with this mod (Data\SKSE\Plugins\StorageUtilData\CompanionsProgressionReqs.json). You can set any positive numbers.
	- This mod applies the values when you start a new game (or on the first game loading when installing midgame), i.e. changes in the json won't be applied if the mod is already loaded. If you really need to change them, you can probably deactivate the .esp, save game, and activate it again.
	COMPATIBILITY
		This mod doesn't edit any vanilla records and is compatible with everything. Load order doesn't matter.
		Not needed and won't work with At Your Own Pace - Companions since it includes the same feature.
		
	More Radiant Quests for Companions - DISABLE

	Thalmor Don't Report To Stormcloaks 1.0 lilebonymace
	https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/73890
	Thalmor don't report crimes in holds controlled by Stormcloaks.
	- Thalmor don't report crimes in holds controlled by Stormcloaks (it requests CWScript for the current hold owner). Because Thalmor and guards of those holds are enemies both by logic and in fact, it doesn't make sense for Thalmor to report crimes to guards and the guards to listen to them while trying to kill each other.
	- This is an alternative to Thalmor Do Not Report Crimes, which makes them don't report crimes in any hold.
	- Recommended to use with Truly Neutral Prisoners.
	COMPATIBILITY
		Conflicts with mods that edit the same vanilla script. Make sure nothing overwrites this mod, otherwise it won't work. A version for Better Courier﻿ is available in the optional files.
		Applies to all Thalmor encounters that have WECrimeFactionAliasScript script attached, not only the vanilla ones
		Doesn't make sense to use with Thalmor Do Not Report Crimes﻿
		Compatible with USSEP and NARC

	https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/60994

	DESCRIPTION - Allows you to acquire Bolar's Oathblade during (or after) the Ill Met By Moonlight quest as well. Without this mod the blade disappears when the quest starts and (according to UESP) may appear again only after a month. With this mod the blade is always there, waiting for you to take it.
	COMPATIBILITY - Quest Conflict Fixes includes a similar edit, you don't need both.
		Compatible with everything else that doesn't change the location of the blade (so probably just with everything).
	DO NOT INSTALL - prefer Quest Conflict Fixes

	DL: SunHelm Survival and needs Alternate Start Mods - Settings Loader 1.2.0 16 mar 2023
		For SunHelm Survival and needs v.3.1.4
	- This is QoL type mod. Modifies MCM for SunHelm Survival and needs by colinswrath.

	- This mod adds some very important simplifications and improvements:
	- Automatically saves your settings when you close MCM as defaults, so you don't have to close Skyrim and move anything to the default settings location.
	- Moves the loading of settings from OnInit to OnConfigInit and adds a 10-second delay to their loading, so that settings are loaded correctly even with a lot of scripts running at the beginning of the game.

	SkyUI - Ghost Item Bug Fix 1.0
	https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/49106
	Fixes the issue where SkyUI favourite groups may not equip correctly under certain circumstances, such as after upgrading items.
	- Summary: This is an updated Papyrus script that fixes the Ghost Item problem where you if you upgrade or drop (amongst other things) an item what was in a SkyUI favourite group, you can no longer equip similar items in that group using the group equip key.
	- Problem description: You will most likely encounter this error if you have added an item to multiple favourite groups and upgrade or drop the item without first removing it from the groups. When you later add another item to these groups and that item occupies the same equipment slot as the removed item (e.g. rings, head, body), the new item might not equip and any item that is currently equipped in that slot will unequip when you use the group equip key.
	- This occurs because a function that is meant to blacklist missing or changed items stops looking after it finds the first group with an item, leaving any other occurrences as ghost items that block that equipment slot when you try to use those groups.

	Roggvir's Execution Scene Fixes 2.0 lilebonymace
	https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/74652
	- Fixes some bugs in Roggvir's execution scene that mostly happen with mods:
	- After the scene people go away very slowly if your timescale is lower than vanilla. It happens because the times between each group of people going away are specified in game time (0.1 hour), so that what feels good on timescale 20 feels like something is broken on timescale 8. With this mod the waiting time is calculated based on your timescale, so that the real time passed is the same as with vanilla timescale (i haven't simply changed it to real time for compatibility reasons). I capped the waiting time at 0.025 game hours, since RegisterForUpdateGameTime() doesn't work on extremely low values, but i've heard that too low timescale causes issues anyway.
	- NPCs can interact with Roggvir's body after the scene (go up to the scene, look at Roggvir's body and kneel down touching him, say generic dead body comments). This seems to mostly happen with mods that change AI detection settings. I workarounded it by preventing detection of dead Roggvir using po3's Papyrus Extender.
	Compatibility:
		Conflicts with mods that edit the same vanilla script. Must not be overwritten, otherwise it won't work.
		Compatible with USSEP﻿ and Scene Tweak - Roggvir's Execution - Restored Dialogue﻿.
		A version for About Roggvir...﻿ can be found in the optional files.

	Geirmund's Hall Pull Chain 1.0 by Livelynightmare

	So I was doing Forbidden Legend the other day. You know, get the Gaulder amulet, kill the three bosses, reforge it. Got to Geirmund's Hall, dropped into the dungeon, killed the boss, and...the door didn't open. The door is supposed to open when you kill the boss.
	Next step obviously: check UESP. And in the bug reports, lo and behold, it's a known issue that sometimes the door simply fails to trigger properly. So I added a pull chain connected to the door. Now I can't get stuck there anymore, and neither can you.

	This is designed as a sister mod to More Faction Members.  Both are ESP-FE.
	Areas with some improvement in v1:
