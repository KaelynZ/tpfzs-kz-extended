Disabled:	DXMCO - Creeatures
	My dog companion wasnt animating when he walked, just gliding as a statue.  Disabling DXMCO - Creatures fixes problem

Disabled:		Root Builder
	Moved to a StockGame installation of SSE, kept within the base TPFZS MO2 folder.
	Due to my MO2 crashing a lot on installing/removing mods, RB kept messing up, copying things to overwrite, hanging, etc.
	Plus, there was always a 5 second delay starting or exiting the game.
	So, for stability and speed, moved to a TPFDE-like 'StockGame' installation.
	Create a 'StockGame' folder in the TPFZS main MO folder.
	Fill it with a 1.5.97 game, including data, esms, bsas, and ESPECIALLY CC content.
	Look at the 'Data/Root' folder inside MO right hand Data pane, and copy all files listed to the new StockGame folder
	Edit all the MO executables (or create new ones) to point to new location in StockGame.
	Nemesis needs a new ini, either reinstall or copy existing ini to a new mod folder.
	Change Nemesis_Engine\nemesis.ini :  SkyrimDataDirectory=auto
	Nemesis will update that to the new location after first run.
	Add to SSEdit executable command line: -D:"<TPFDX folder>\\StockGame\\data"

	v1.0.13
	Mod Order: N/A
	Notes: Add NFF Ignore Tokens to custom followers that use their own AI (just another Quality of Life minifix)
		This mod aims to supply with a vetted SPID distribution-list for followermods and/or NPCs that are NOT to be imported into NFF.  Blocking is done by means of using SPID to distribute the 'NFF Ignore Token' into the respective followers inventory, basically stopping the player from importing it into the NFF framework (at least not without explicitly cleaning the follower inventory first).
		Handles all the cool follower mods, practically a list of the best ones around.

ESLify:
	Lilly - A fully-voiced female courier replacer and follower
	Notes:  only do this AFTER installing Appearance Replacer
	Procedure: 
		Highly recommend installing ESLifyEverything in MO2 folder, because you will need a different setup for each MO2 installation.
		In MO2, create an empty mod named 'ESLifyEverything Output'.  Enable it.
		In MO2 Excutables menu, add ESLifyEverything.  Check 'Create files in mod' option, point to 'ESLifyEverything Output'
		Edit ESLifyEverything/AppSettings.json.  Update file paths to correct locations.  My version looks like:
			"XEditFolderPath": "c:\\Portable Apps\\xEdit",
			"DataFolderPath": "C:\\TPFZS\\Stock Game\\Data",
			"OutputFolder": "c:\\TPFZS\\mods\\ESLifyEverything Output",
			"MO2": {
				"MO2Support": true,
				"OutputPluginsToSeperateFolders": true,
				"MO2ModFolder": "c:\\TPFZS\\mods"
			}
			
		Start SSEEdit on Seraphim - PrettyCourier.esp and Lilly Replacer Default Equipment.esp
		On Seraphim - Pretty Courier.esp, Compact FormIDs for ESL, then set ESL flag in File Header.
		Exit SSEEdit, saving both altered esps
		Run ESLifyEverything.exe.  This is most easily done from MO2, but can also be done externally.  It does not use MO's virtual file system.

MOD EDIT:
	Even Better Quest Objectives
	Goal: Put scripts in a BSA.   Use BSArchPro.exe from https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/63243.  Hide loose scripts.
	Why:  EBQO scripts must override those in USSEP, but I want the overridden my scripts in other mods, such as Alternative College Entry.  Unfortunately, scripts in ACE are in a BSA file, while the EBQO scripts are loose, which means they will *always* override the ACE versions.  Rather than unpacking the ACE scripts, the proper thing to do is put the EBQO scripts into a BSA, which is how the mod should have been packaged in the first place.
	This means that if EBQO gets reinstalled, this BSA packing will have to be done again.

	https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/86848?tab=files
	Download: Clouds AIO 1.4
	Notes: No performance impact (winterhold is the heaviest).  Lod friendly.  Clouds are full lod - you do not need to generate or re-generate lod for this. You do not need to disable this mod to generate lod with dyndolod. They are visible from very far away.  Load order - Fully compatible. Use with any weather mod. Place this above water mods. Or you get water seams. Nothing else needs to be done. If in doubt, place this high (low priority) in your load order in regards with other mods that edit worldspaces. This is highly compatible, and I could not find anything else besides whats in the misc files.

	Meet Caesia, the cocky and mysterious mage. She will accompany you in your adventure and use her witty dialogue to entertain you. Discover her story as you progress your relationship with her.
	DL: v2.0b
	LOOT: with other followers
	Notes: This mod can be seen as an immensely simplified version of Shezarrine: The Fate Of Tamriel﻿ (which, I desperate need level designers, scripters, and modelers, please help if you have the time). Caesia herself, however, is mutually exclusive with that mod, though theoretically they can be installed and used together, their stories are incompatible.  Fount in Morthal inn.

	Caesia Slightly Enhanced 1.1

	https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/5941
	Provides adult themed content for the dragonborn. In a world beset by violence, Flower Girls aims to share love. It can be considered an all-in-one solution for those looking for both lighthearted entertainment, or the immersion of giving your character an active love life.
	Notes:  This mod is REQUIRED for much adult content.  Adult mods generally uses either Flower Girls, OStim, or Sexlab for their adult animations; many mods have patches allowing you to choose which of those three frameworks the mod will use.  Any or all of those three frameworks can be installed simultaneously, though any given mod will use only one.   Flower Girls is the simplest and least customizable of those animation frameworks.
	DL: FlowerGirls SE and VR Main File 3.0.2
	LOOT: esm file, will autosort with other esms
	
	Seductress Faye - Custom voiced FG Follower 1.7

INSTALL NOTES:
	My modlist has now reached its ESP limit, with the highest esp being at index FC.  In order to add more mods, we must disable, merge, or elsify existing mods.

ESLIFY:
	DBVO_Base.esp  - use Wrye Bash to set ESL Flag.  No editing or compaction needed.

ESLIFY:
	Alchemists Vestments.esp
	mod: Alchemists Vestments - CBBE Refit
	- can use xEdit to compact FormIDs, then set ESL flag in file header.  This mod has only textures and meshes, no scripts, voices, or faces.  In my load order, it has no dependencies (check with Wrye Bash, right click on esp, List Dependencies), so it does not need to be loaded with anything else in xEdit before eslifying.  *DO NOT* edit the existing esp in place; create a copy of the mod (or at least the esp) in another folder in MO2's mods folder, enable it, then edit the copy.  Note than in default TPFZS load order, the correct Alchemists Vestments.esp to edit is in the mod The Alchemist's Vestments - CBBE Refit.

ESLIFY
	NoRoadPredatorsRedone.esp
	mod: No Road Predators Redone
	-- esp-only mod, no dependents in my load order.  Copy mod, then compact formIDs and set ESL flag in xEdit new esp

ESLIFY
	NoGrassINCaves.esp
	mod: No Grass in Caves
	-- esp-only mod, no dependents in my load order.  Copy mod, then compact formIDs and set ESL flag in xEdit new esp

	Super Simple Lock Bash.esp
	mod: Super Simple Lock Bash
	-- mod has scripts in bsa, but scripts do not refer to any specific formIDs.  No other assets.  No dependents in my load order.   Copy esp into new mod, then compact formIDs and set ESL flag in xEdit new esp
	
ESLIFY
	suspiciouscityguards.esp
	mod: Suspicious City Guards
	-- mod has scripts in bsa, but scripts do not refer to any specific formIDs.  No other assets.  No dependents in my load order.   Copy esp into new mod, then compact formIDs and set ESL flag in xEdit new esp

ESLIFY
	saddlebags.esp
	mod: Iron Dusk's Laboratory - Saddlebags
	-- mod has scripts in bsa, but scripts do not refer to any specific formIDs.  No other assets.  No dependents in my load order.   Copy esp into new mod, then compact formIDs and set ESL flag in xEdit new esp
	--- note that this mod is for oldrim, Skyrim LE
	--- fix esp by loading into Creation Kit, then re-saving.  will change to a form 44 esp

ESLIFY
	MaiqAnniversaryEdition.esp
	mod: M'aiq The Liar Modders Edition
	-- mod has voice files, no other assets.  No dependents in my load order.  No cells created.  Copy esp into new mod.  Activate new mod, disable original mod.  Open xEdit, select only your new mod.  Use the CTRL + ALT + E shortcut or the "Apply Script" command and select "__ESPFEFollower﻿" script (from ESPFE Follower - Eslify facegen and voices https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/56396 - read the instructions).  This script will compact the formIDs, set the ESL flag, and rename the voice files.  Copy new files from wherever xEdit put them (overwrite by default, or specified output directory in MO2 executable tab) into your new mod.  Don't worry about removing old fuz files - they won't hurt anything.
	
TESTING:
	My last mod index is now F4, meaning I now have 9 free esp slots.  I could do more, except that the other mods I could eslify either have dependents (many just ZedPatch) or more complex assets.  Time to test.  Must start new game, cannot load old game with eslified esps, that's a sure path to countless problems.  Delete old saves first, for safety.  Run Nemesis.  Start game.

INSTALL:

	DL: (4) Community Overlays 2 - Main - CBBE and Male 1.0
	DNI: esp file, needs to be eslified
	
DISABLE:
	Sofia Follower - Alternate Spawn for Compatibility
	Reason:  Don't like the location, inside the stable with (in my load order) a horse.  Makes first conversation bad, with a horse in the way.  Only reason to move her is that ICAIO spawns a table right on top of her, which looks stupid.  Better solution is to disable table spawn once ICAIO is installed.
	
TODO:
REINSTALL:
	Saints and Seducers Extended Cut

GAMEPLAY NOTES:
	2023-05-03  12:43pm
	Started new game.
	Issue: MCM recorder script could not find an option for EVG conditional Idles - Shield Cover
	Issue: Hands of character are blue/purple, indicating missing texture.
	try: Rebuilt 3BBB 3BA body parts in BodySlide
	Result:  fixed hands!
	Issue: my high elf companion is not in riverwood inn at startup.  Recorder is, though.  And Gorr.  No wenches, either.
	No Alternate Conversation Camera in MCM
	CTD on save while in Rigmor quest
	edited Alternate Conversation Camera ini, always go to 1st person

INSTALL:
	Improved Alternate Conversation Camera 1.2.0
	https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/68210
	Improved version of Alternate Conversation Camera by NasGorTelorCeplok with MCM, fixes and more.
	DL: Improved Alternate Conversation Camera SE v1.2.0
	LOOT: anywhere
	Notes:  This totally replaces the dll used by Alternate Conversation Camera, which does not have an esp, so it is totally drop-in compatible.  It uses the same ini file as ACC, so if you have a personalized ACC ini file, copy that file into a new mod that loads later than ImprovedACC.

DISABLE:
	Alternate Conversation Camera
	Reason:  now using Improved Alternate Conversation Camera
	Notes:  Do not remove mod, just uninstall in in your profile, as vanilla TPFZS uses it
	
GAMEPLAY:
	CTD in Rigmor quest, after delivering her to camp - CTD on entering boat (fast travel) to return to standing stones.
	This did *not* occur on my last playthrough.  Time to hit xEdit.

	https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/89676?tab=files
	Notes: ESL-flagged. Safe to install midgame. Place AFTER Taunt your Enemies (both for the esp and files).

ON THE RADAR:
	Remiel Refined - COtR - ESL Flagged
	https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/90614
	Remiel NPC Overhaul changes Remiel's appearance and you can optionally change her armor to HDT-SMP Melony Armor (by Fuse00).
	Note: This mod does not require COtR or CBBE! This mod overhauls Remiel using COtR and CBBE body texture. You can also optionally give HDT-SMP Melony Armor (by Fuse). You don't need to have COTR and CBBE installed because everything is already included in this mod. Also, COtR uses its own face textures for males and this means that there always be a slight neck seam or a bit unnatural transition between the neck and the body.
	DO NOT INSTALL YET.  Want to see original Remiel before I start editing her.  This one is really cute, though - I'm a sucker for big round glasses.
	
ON THE RADAR:
	HDT-SMP Melony Armor
	https://www.patreon.com/posts/hdt-smp-melony-67711235
	HDT-SMP light armor for female CBBE/UNP (also compatible with other CBBE/UNP variations like CBBE 3BA/BHUNP (since they share the same textures)).
	Notes: Physics is enabled for belt props and body (breasts/buttocks). Includes: Body armor; Gauntlets; Boots; Faster HDT-SMP plugin is required to run the physics. The armor can be crafted on forge and tempered on workbench, or type "help melony" in the console to find related ARMO ID and spawn an item with "player.additem <ID> 1" command, or use mods like QUI or AddItemMenu.
	DO NOT INSTALL YET.  HDT-SMP Physics is not yet installed.

	Kaidan 2 - Autumnwatch Lodge and Dwarven Mail CC Patch
	https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/64822
	A small patch for Kaidan 2's Autumnwatch Lodge player home and the Alternative Armors - Dwarven Mail Creation Club.
	DL: main v1.1 23 mar 2022
	Notes: Kaidan's home overwrites and removes a unmarked campsite used by CC.  This mod removes those edits, re-enabling the vanilla campsite.
	LOOT: shortly after 0Kaidan.esp

	Immersive Kaidan Start
	https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/64064
	Kaidan 2 is a popular follower mod, but it always bugged me that you are given a quest to find him from the start of the game. This patch removes the objective to find him on the start of the game, and instead adds a few ways to find him in game in a more immersive way.
	DL: main v 2.1.1 19 apr 2022

	Fix the T pose of the bone colossus skeleton from the creation club content "Necromantic Grimoire".
	DL: main v1.0 06 feb 2022
	Notes: Somehow the mod hdt-smp/ faster hdt-smp messed up the skeleton of the lurkers from the dragonborn dlc and caused them to keep having the infamous T-pose glitch. XPMSSE fixed the issue but the fix was not applied to the bone colossus added by cc, which used the skeleton of the lurkers. This mod simply replaces the bone colossus skeleton with the fixed lurker skeleton.
	
	(CC Fishing) Rubbish Retrieval Bugfix
	https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/77453
	Rubbish Retrieval radiant quest was supossed to send you to either Markarth, Riften, Dawnstar or Morthal. However, due to an implementation bug, the possibilities of being sent to Dawnstar or Morthal are very slim. Rejoice yourself, because with this mod you will be able to experience this epic quest as it was originally intended.

	Orcish Orc Strongholds - Creation Club Orcish Armors Integrated

	Integrated Orcish Plate and Orcish Scaled from Creation Club by giving members of Orc Strongholds the appropriate equipment.
	DL: Orcish Orc Strongholds 1.0a 29 apr 2022
	Notes: The reasoning behind giving the armors to these specific NPCs was simply based on their vanilla equipment: whoever equipped vanilla Scaled set will receive the equivalent Orcish Scaled parts, and Orcish Plate for Steel. Currently, this integration only affects Orc Strongholds most, hence its name. I've no plan to integrate it to leveled list as it would be covered by Creation Club Integration - Armours

	An all-encompassing integration and distribution mod that includes modules for a wide array of different content.
	DL: main v1.3.3 27 mar 2023
	LOOT: For the best results load Tamrielic Distribution.esp and all its plugins as low in your load order as possible.
		Tamrielic Distribution - Lucien.esp  immediately after Lucien.esp
		Tamrielic Distribution - Moon Monk Robes and Lunar Guard Armor.esp  immediately after Kad_MoonMonkRobes.esp
		Tamrielic Distribution - Unique Stros M'Kai Rum.esp immediately after StrosMKaiRum.esp
		Tamrielic Distribution - Save the Icerunner Patch.esp immediately after SaveTheIcerunner.esp
	FOMOD: what it auto-selects.
	Notes:There are a handful of mods I recommend you pair with Tamrielic Distribution to further integrate content into your game. While this mod has a few modules for Alternative Armor content it doesn't actually add the armors into loot lists. I recommend you use On a Crimson Trail for this. Not only does it cleanly and naturally add all these armors to vanilla loot lists but it also overhauls the quests to feel more natural and interconnected. I provide optional plugins to disable the Alternative Armor quests for all the content not currently covered by Crimson Trail. If you use the Crossbow Collection Module it is recommended that you pair it with Thwack. I also recommend you pick up Kachuck to completely integrate Anniversary Edition's crossbows.

	YES!!!! I'm in!  And its so late i need to crash.  Tomorrow...
	
==========
2023-05-06
==========

NEW RELEASE:
	TPFZS 0.9.4
	released today, numerous changes.
	Use Wabbajck to find The Phoenix Flavor Zediious Sprinkles
	Recommend:  BACKUP existing Wabbjack\downloaded_mod_lists\Zediious_@@_thephoenixflavor_zedsprinkles.wabbajack files before downloading new version.
	
	Download new wabbackajack file.
	Run new wabbajack file.
	Set Downloads folder to wherevere yove already put stuff (C:\SSE Downloads on my rig)
	Set Output folder to a new folder (C:\TPFZS094 on my rig)
	Installed in new c:\TPFZS094 folder, which is reference that will be used in later steps.
	CLEAN your existing Steam Skyrim SE install (C:\Steam\steamapps\common\Skyrim Special Edition on my rig).  I mean, clean - straight from factory version, no extraneous dlls or xEdit or anything new in Data.  If need be, rename your existing SSE folder to SSE.old or something, then download a new copy using Steam using 'check files integrity option').  If you installed a new version, make sure you run it alt least once, to get the ini files set up.
	Run your new TPFZS 0.9.4 game.  Start up c:\TPFSZ094\Mod Organizer.exe.  Insure the big button up right refers to SKSE, no a purge or some other tool.  Click it.
	Have fun playing your new TPFZE 0.9.4!
	
	Now, it's time to get to work.  We're going to merge TPFZS 0.9.4 into the existing (highly modified) TPFZS 0.9.3.5, MO folder, while keeping working profile for th eold version, the old modified version, the new TPFZS 0.9.4 version, and 0.9.4 with all my new mods added.
	
	This will require about 300 GB of free space on your disk.
	

FIND DIFFERENCES:
	Tool:  Meld 3.22.0
	https://meld.app/
	Procedure:
		Preferences menu (3 bars in upper right header):
			Folder Comparisons:
				UNCHECK Apply text filters during folder comparisons
			File Filters:
				add new category 'MO Metadata', pattern 'meta.ini'.
				CHECK Media
				CHECK MO Metadata
		File Filters:  (button in Upper right header)
			UNCHECK Same
			CHECK New				(was UNCHECK, that is an error)
			CHECK Modified
			CHECK Backups
			CHECK OS-Specific Metadata
			CHECK Version Control
			CHECK Modified
			CHECK Binaries
			CHECK Media
			CHECK Mo Metadata
			UNCHECK Ignore filename case
			UNCHECK Normalize Unicode paths
			
	Compare Folders:
		mods/ folder in old installation (C:\TPFZ\mods, on my rig)
		mods/ folder in new installation (C:\TPFZ094\mods, on my rig)
		
	- Produces a list of mods that contain different files between the two versions.  Should be only a few dozen.  Right click and collapse all folders, the open mods/, to see just the mods that are different, as opposed to filly expanded version showing the files.

RENAME MODS:
	- Now go into the new mods/ folder (C:\TPFSZ094\mods) and Rename all mods listed in the new mods folder that are different from their old version.   I added a version number and the string 'TPFZ094'.  E.g.  if mod 'foobar' is listed as changed, and MO says the new version is x.y, rename C:\TPFZS094\mods\foobar to 'foobar x.y TPFZS094'.  This will clearly label it by version number, and indicate that it came from the TPFZS 0.9.4 build.
	
	- Now re-run the comparison in Meld.  It should now list zero differences, as you have renamed all the folders with changes, so they now coult as 'new' folders rather than 'modified' ones.  If not zero, go and finish renaming all the TPFZS094 mods that are still showing up.
	
	- Now the TPFZ094/mods folder only contains two sorts of mods:
		1. those that are identical to their old versions (the majority, though technically their metadata differs), and
		2. new folders that have no equivalent name in the old install, either because they're new to 0.9.4, or because we just renamed them.

BACKUP:
	BACKUP the existing TPFZS mods/ folder, by creating a copy of it (I named mine 'mods 0.9.3.5 backup').  This will be a big folder; make sure you have enough disk space. (mine was 226.1 GB, and took over 15 minutes to back up).  We can eventually remove theis backup, but only after we're certain everything is working.

CHECK FREE SPACE:
	Make sure you have enough disk space, at least 190 GB free.  While we dont technically need enough for the entire mods/ folder, as most of it wont't get copied, Explorer wont do the copy if there's not enough space.

	If you don't have enought space, the next step can be a MOVE rather a COPY, but that's riskier  If you have time, compress the backup copy of mods/ that you just made.  This will take a long while, nearly 2.5 hours on my SSD - go get lunch or something - but will compress 225 GB down to about 80, freeing up 150 GB.  However, it would be faster have have Wabbajack re-install the files you moved rather than do a compression.
	

COPY (or MOVE) NEW mods from 0.9.4 into existing MO folders:
	COPY TPFZS094\mods folder to TPFZS, or MOVE if lacking enough free space.
	This will result in overwrite warnings.  DO NOT replace/overwrite anything.  CHECK 'Do this for all future conflicts button'.  Wait.
	
OVERLOOKED FLAW:
	The comparison I did omitted new files - so it overlooked those mods that changed by adding new files, or by hiding files, or moving esps to the optional/ folder.  These are real version changes that need to be handled by creating new mods, but at least no files got overwritten: the existing mods should still work just fine in existing profiles, though they need new versions to work with 0.9.4.  Fortunately, there aren't many.
	
	Future Note:  Show 'New' files in Meld comparison, and rename mods with new files, too.
	
COPY PROFILE:
	Create a copy of the 'Refined' profile in TPFZS 0.9.4(and any new ones you've created), in C:\TPSFS\profiles
	Rename to copy to 'Refined 0.9.4'.
	Move that new profile (and any others you may have created) to C:\TPFZS\profiles.

FIXING MY ERROR:
	Start Wabbajack
	click on middle button, Intall Downloaded
	Should still be pointing to new TPFZS version.
	Select same folders as used before:  C:\TPFZS094 and C:\SSE Downloads, for me
	UNCHECK 'Overwrite Installation'.  We just want to update it, not throw it away and start over.  At least, st this point.
	Click the bug green start arrow.
	Enjoy the slide slow as it checks to see whats already there and downloads what's not, same as an interupted install.
	It should only need to re-install about a dozen mods, less than 30 GB.  But one of those mods is DynDOLOD output, which is huge.
	Close when done.
	Boot up 0.9.4 to make sure it's ok.

LOOK FOR MODS WITH NEW CONTENT:
	Boot up Meld.  Same folders as before, will be in list of saved comparisons.
	File Filters:  (button in Upper right header)
			UNCHECK Same
			CHECK New				(was UNCHECK, that is an error)
			UNCHECK Modified		( we dont want to see the ones we renamed and copied before)
	Now look at the right pane (TPFZS094).  Ignore crossed out mods.
	Of the mods NOT crossed out, look over in the right pane, and see if there is already a TPFZS094 flagged version in TPFSZ.
	Ignore those.
	For the mods that do NOT have a TPFZS094 variant yet, open the TPFZS094 Mod Organizer, and rename them.  There should only be a handful.
	I found:
		Misc. College of Winterhold Tweaks
		SkySight Male Skin
		Tactical Valtheim
	Rename them all in MO by adding a version numver and 'TPFZS094'
	COPY the newly renamed mods over to TPFZS/mods.
	Close TPFZS094 MO2.

Update the Refine 0.9.4 Profile in old MO
	Open the old MO, the one for TPFZS 0.9.3.5
	It should have at least one new profile, Refined 0.9.4.
	Switch to profile Refined 0.9.4
	You should see what looks like a perfectly good profile, with lots and lots of mods (everything 0.9.4 doesnt use) unchecked at the end.
	In the left pane filter box, enter 'TPFZS094'.
	At the bottom, you should see the three new mods you added, unchecked.
	Check them.
	Clear the filter box.  Filter on <Active> mods.
	For each of the 3 new mods you just added, move the mod to just after the mod with the same name that des not have the 'TPFZ094' tag, and uncheck the version that does not have the TPFZ094 tag

ACTIVATE CC CONTENT IF NECCESSARY
	If you have replaced the fake CC content used by TPFZS with the real stuff (as I did), then you need another step.
	In the right pane, Plugins tab, sort by flags, click again if need be to get the paperclips up top.
	You may see a couple of red triangles.  In my case, ZedPatch2 and HFE-CC Fishing Patch were both missing CC Fish (ccBGSSSE001-Fish.esm) as a master.
	Find it in your Plugins list, and check it to activate it.
	
TEST
	Keep the new Refined 0.9.4 profile active.
	Start SKSE.
	With any luck, the game should start with all the new mods, no problem.
	Note:  if you have disabled Root Loader and are using a private version of Skyrim SE (as I did), this game will be using the ENB (or lack thereof) of your existing setup, not that of 0.9.4.

IT LIVES!!!
	Victory!  0.9.4 is now working in my old 0.9.3.5 MO, in a profile that has only the 0.9.4 stuff activated, with all the old stuff and all my new mods deactivated.  Continuing testing.

OKAY, NOW WHAT?

CREATE NEW PROFILES
	Copy the Refined 0.9.4 profile to a new MO profile named KZ 0.9.4
	KZ 0.9.4 will be the profile we will be working with now.
	The old KZ profile (which worked) is now frozen, and not to be edited in the course of normal events.
	Also copy the Refined 0.9.4 profile to tow other new profiles - Refined 0.9.4 Original, and Refined 0.9.4 Experimental.
	The Refined 0.9.4 Original profile is a backup that will never be touched.
	The Refined 0.9.4 Experimental profile is the one we're gonna use for experiments.

FIX THE MOD LIST for KZ 0.9.4
	This was a complex task requiring clever use of Meld to compare the old KZ profile to the new one, and insert old stuff where appropriate.
	Not easily explained.
	It worked, and I have a working load order.
	
FIX THE LOAD ORDER
	This is trickier.  MO does not like anyone editing load orders except itself or a tool; I can't easily do it using Meld, at least not while MO is running.
	Given that the load order from KZ is *mostly* correct - while new versions of mods were installed, they tended to use the same esps, it will be easiest to start with the KZ load order.
	Procedure:
		1. In MO right pane, create a backup the the current (KZ 0.9.4) load order, using the 'Create a Backup' button.
		2. Close MO
		3. Copy TPFZ/profiles/KZ/loadorder.txt to TPFZ/profiles/KZ 0.9.4.  Confirm overwrite.
		4. Open MO.
		5. The loadorder in the left pane should mostly look like the old KZ order, but with a bunch of new unchecked esps at the end.
		6. Activate Wyre Smash.
		7. Select all, then right click and Check ESL Qualifications.
		8. About a dozen esps can be eslified - we did this for 0.9.3.5, now we need to do it again.  For each esp in the list (they'll be green in the esp list), right click and Set ESL Flag, until no more can be easily eslified.
		9.  Close Wyre Smash.
		10.  In right pane, right click, then Enable All.  Say yes when it confirms.
		11.  If you scroll to end, the highest non-FE Mod Index should be FD or less.  If not, you got work to do to bring that count down - something will have to be disabled.
		12.  Now put all the new mods (the ones that sort after the last mod in the old KX profile) in the right spots.
		13.  In a text editor, outside of MO, open TPF/profiles/R4fined 0.9.4 Experimental/loadorder.txt.  We're just going to be viewing it, not editing, so set it readonly. (In Notepad++, open Edit menu.  At bottom is 'Set Read-Only')
		14. For each new mod in the MO mod list, find it in the open loadorder.txt file.  See what's around it.  Move the mod in the MO list to the same location, or as close as possible.
		15.  When done, use the button to Create a Backup of your load order
		16. Now we need to check that all dependents are positioned after their masters.
		17. Open Wrye Bash
		18. Find "Bash Patch, 0.esp".
		19.  Right click menu, select 'Rebuild Patch ...', down in lower half.
		20.  You will probably get a popup window named 'Master Errors', with panels showing 'Missing Master Errors' (shouldn't be any) and 'Delinquent Master Errors' (may be a few).  If you have many, you'll want to write them down; due to stupidly of Wrye interface, you can't just copy-paste the error list into a new file.
		21.  Close Wrye Bash.  DO NOT just unlock MO underneath it!
		22. Go over to your MO load order, and move any file with a delinquent master (the top ones in the tree, with the required master underneath) to just after it's delinquent master.  Alternatively, move the master before the dependent.  Whatever works for you.  23.  Back up your load order.
		24.  Open Wrye Bash again, try to rebuild bash patch again.  If you get the Missing Master Errors again, keep fixing until you don't.
		25.  If you get the the 'Update Bashed Patch, 0.esp' popup window, just Cancel.  We don't actually want to build a patch, we just wanted to find delinquent and missing masters.
		26.  Close Wrye Bash.
		27.  Make sure every esp that should be enabled is, in fact, enabled.  Click on the column 'Mod Index'  it will show unchecked esps up top.  You may have a few, as TPFZS removed a few mods that you may have made patches for.  Make sure the only unchecked mods are the ones you WANT unchecked, probably because they're missing masters.  Probably best to disable their mods, but not strictly neccessary.  If you make any changes, backup your load order again.
		28.  Make sure there is no little red error triangle in the upper right of MO, indicating Missing Masters.
		28.  Your load order should now be functional!  Time to test it.
		
TESTING
	1.  Start SKSE.  See if the game starts.  If so, you're golden!
	2.  Create a new character.
	3.  Wait for all MCM messages to finish.
	4.  Equip your character with stuff in starting room, but do not choose a fate.
	5.  Save game.
	6.  Quit
	7.  In MO Profile Manage, copy your now-working KZ 0.9.4 profile to a new profile named KZ 0.9.4 Baseline.  You will not edit the new profile, or even use it much.  But it's there to go back to a version known to load.
	8.  Now restart the game, and get to playing!
	
==========================================
2012-05-07  Cleaning up the KZ 0.9.4 Build
==========================================
Active Profile: KZ 0.9.4

RUN Nemesis
	Last night, I forgot to run Nemesis on my new build, so animations would definitely be off.
	Time to do it now.
	1. Insure we have an enabled mod named "(KZ 0.9.4) Nemesis Output".  If it doesn't exist, create it.
	2. Open the mod "Nemesis Output 0.9.4 TPSFZ094" in Explorer (right click, Open in Explorer)
	3. Select and copy everything in it, except meta.ini
	4. Open the mod '(KZ 0.9.4) Nemesis Output in Explorer
	5. Paste everything we just copied into it.  If there is an overwrite warning, say yes, we want to overwrite.
	6.  Open the Modify Executables window.
	7.  Select Nemesis.
	8.  CHECK 'Create file in mod instead of overwrite (*)'
	9.  Insure that the folder named for that option is "(KZ 0.9.4) Nemesis Output"
	10.  Click OK to close the window.
	11.  Run Nemesis.  Update Engine, then Launch Nemesis Behavior Engine.
	12. It should end with the middle bar being a yellow-green, and saying something like "9151 animation(s)".  This number is substantially higher than the number in base TPFZS 0.9.4, because KZ 0.9.4 contains OStim NG, which adds lots of animations, plus some other animation packs.
	13.  Close Nemesis.

TEST
	Start the game and load the save I made last night, with the character still in the starting cell.
	Test things.
	1.  Test if OBody actually changes the body shape (F10 in TPFZS default, F8 in KZ build)
	2.  Test if iEquip works, by adding weapons to the right hand queue.
	
	Did the above, and things are looking good.  Now it's time to actually playtest the sucker more extensively, before diving into today's modifications.

Cleanup
	Remove saves/ folder from newly added profiles in my GIT repository.
	Remove old saves from KZ 0.9.4 profile
	Disable mod 'Nemesis Output 0.9.4 TPSFZ094' in KZ 0.9.4 profile
	
INSTALL:

	DL: NCC2020SE v1.01 6 dec 2020
	Notes: This mod uses some SKSE wizardry to strip you of your prisoner's outfit when the character creation menu opens. This makes it compatible with both vanilla start and all alternate start mods.
	Notes: 	Numerous reports in forum of it not working.  Needs testing.
	Notes:  esp file needs to be eslified

NEW MOD:
	Naked Character Creation v1.01 - KZ eslified esp replacer
	Procedure:  Copy NCC2020.esp to new mod with that name.  activate.  xEdit with just that mod.  Set ESL flag in file header - no compaction needed.  Exit xEdit.
		
TEST:
	Nope, Naked Character Creation doesn't work for me.

UNINSTALL:
	Naked Character Creation 2020 SE
	
INSTALL:
	CBBE 3BA (3BBB) - Settings Loader
	https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/56875
	Created from scratch MCM for CBBE 3BA (3BBB) by Acro748 to support MCM Helper.

	DL: Kri's EWM Custom Compilation v1.1.2 28 jan 2023
	Notes: I CANNOT EMPHASIZE ENOUGH that this DOES NOT CHECK ANYTHING. If you give yourself access to these powers before you've earned them, it's cheating and that's on you.  This was made for my personal load order and is presented AS IS. However if you don't use one or more of these plugins, the mod will still work for you - and just fail with probably a papyrus error if you try to use the ability of a mod you don't have. The ESP itself has no requirements.

	Helnen start.  All good until I have to jump out of tower.  Burning Inn has lots of walls that shouldn't be there, which i can pass through, and are invisible from other side.
	Same thing happens in bruined building I have to run through with Hadvar, after Alduin takes off again - walls that I can pass through.
	Console says they're from DynDOLOD.  When I disable DynDOLOD, the walls vanish, and when I re-enable it, they reappear.  They're definitely the inn walls from before the dragin attack.  And they're not there in vanilla 0.9.4.  I screwed up something, no idea what or how.

	https://www.loverslab.com/blogs/entry/9950-mod-release-karlov-manor-version-40-lese/
	This mod adds a medium sized vampire castle to Skyrim and various screenshot locations (accessible via the carriage in the court or the location access room). It is located in north west of Solitude. 
	Even though normal house usage and gameplay is possible, it is intended for taking screenshots.

	BlockSteal - Prevents accidentally pick up v0.10
	https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/18732
	This mod will prevent you from stealing items. When you try to steal, nothing happens. To steal an item, you have to go in sneak mode, and then you can steal all you like.
	DL: Blocksteal_010_SKSE2017 0.10 22 feb 2020
	Notes: Support for Runtime 1.5.97 (Requires SKSE64 v2.0.17).  Part of Skyrim for Good Guys

	Tidy Up 1.1.2
	https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/34021
	Oh no, you've made a mess. Well, time to put everything right.
	DL: Tidy Up 1.1.2 04 apr 2020
	Notes: As you visit people's houses, maybe even your own house, things can become a bit of a mess. Plates are under the table. A cabbage is rolling down the hallway. How did that pair of gauntlets wind up over there?  This mod lets you sort it all out, one bit of clutter at a time.
	When you launch the game with this mod installed, you'll have a new lesser power, "Tidy Up".  Simply cast it like any other lesser power, and once it's activated, anything that normally you'd be able to pick up now has the option to put back where it belongs; even (especially!) things that don't belong to you!  When you're finished righting everything that's taken a bit of a tumble, cast the power again, to go back to your normal bull-in-a-china-shop self.
	﻿Installation: The archive contains a single ESP-FE plugin and BSA archive. It contains only new record and a few simple scripts.
	Compatibility: It does not work with Block Steal Papyrus﻿.  You can tidy stuff that you do not own, which made me feel like it was going to work, but you always take stuff that has no owner or that you own.  It does work well, however, with BlockSteal - Prevents accidentally pick up﻿﻿.

	KZ Patch - Scamps v0 eslified + TPFZS v094
	
DISABLE:
	iEquip
	Reason:  it's slow, I don't like it, and another user is having problems with MCM recorder restarting after reloading a saved game.  No dependencies, don't need to change anything else.

TESTING:
	Start new game.  Default start.
	Issues:  When trying to look at Alternative Perspectives note in startining cell, failed with error 'Blocksteal.dll could not be loaded'.
	Issue:  Mouse very slow in inventory, despite high FPS
	
	Answer:  From Blocksteal forum: 'on 1.9.57, no animated looting mods, I still get the Blocksteal.dll could not be loaded error  Edit: it was due to eslifying the plugin'
	
DISABLE MOD:
	Blocksteal KZ eslified esp.  Dammit.

TESTING:
	Blocksteal now working fine.
	Wall problem is burning inn in Helgen now gone - moving DynDOLOD did it.
	I got my 'Aldiun not taking off' bug in Helgen again.  It happened during a run where I had DynDOLOD disabled; also, Hadvar got stuck, and only caught up with me again after I ran the gauntlet myself and got into the scene where he and Hadvar exchange words.  When I loaded an earlier save, then enabled DynDOLOD (now working fine), then Aldun and Hadvar worked fine.  Not enough evidence to pin in on DynDOLOD yet, but it's a suspicion.

INSTALL TOOL:
	Synthesis 0.25.4
	https://github.com/Mutagen-Modding/Synthesis/releases
	DL:  0.25.4  Synthesis.zip  4 apr 2023
	Instructions:
		1. Extract to its own folder.  I used C:\Portable Apps\Synthesis 0.25.4
		2. Add as MO2 Executable.  Set output folder to "(KZ 0.9.4) Synthesis Output"
		3. Go to Windows Defender, create Antivirus Exclusion for new Synthesis folder
		4. Run Synthesis in MO2
		5. It will say 'Blocking Error'.  This is because we're using a non-standard Skyrim
		6.  Open Settings (gear icon in upper right).  It will edit the default Skyrim SE profile.
		7. Rename the profile to 'Skyrim SE TPFZS'
		8. Set the Data Folder to the correct patch for your install, e.g. C:\TPFZS\Stock Game\Data
		9. Close Settings by clicking back arrow button in upper left.
		10. Click on the 'Git Repository' button, the one that looks life a tree diagram.
		11. Select 'HighPolyHead-RaceMenuPatcher'
		12. Now in left pane, click on the arrow to run Synthesis.
		13. Wait.  With just the HPH Patcher, it took 37.4 seconds on my rig, and I got an error - Too Many masters 294 > 254
		
	
SET UP SYNTHESIS to HANDLE A HUGE LOAD Order
	Ok, this is tricky.   A single esp can only have 254 masters, so to get Synthesis to fix 285+ esps, I need it to generate 2 different patches, each handling only a fraction of my load order.  Fortunately, this is easy to do.
	1.  Click on the 'Synthesis' entry in the laft pane.  This will being up a right pane with the name 'Synthesis' up top, and a selection window for 'Blacklisted Mods'
	2.  Rename that patcher!  Click on 'Synthesis' in the right pane, and change 'Synthesis' to 'Synthesis HPH RaceMenuPatcher 1'.
	3.  Create a *second* Synthesis patcher group, by clicking on the indented tree icon in the upper left.  This will create a new unnamed group.
	4.  Name the new group 'Synthesis HPH RaceMenuPatcher 2'.
	5.  Add the HPH RaceMenu Patcher to the new group, same as you did before.  You will be a popup saying 'Duplicate Patcher Name'.  Rename the new patcher by adding a '2' to the end.
	6.  Re-enable TPFZS 0.9.4 Synthesis output mod.  This is just for a while.
	7.  Click on the arrow at the bottom left to run both your Synthesis groups.
	8.  Close Synthesis
	9.  You should now have two new esps in your Synthesis output:  'Synthesis RaceMenuPatcher 1.esp' and 'Synthesis RaceMenu Patcher 2.esp'.  Bith should be relatively small, under 2 megs, because they only contain patches that aren't already in the TPFZS Synthesis.esp.
	10.  Disable the TPFZS 0.9.4 Synthesis Output mod.
	11.  In the left plugins pane, enable both new mods.
	12.  Move 'Synthesis HPH RaceMenuPatcher 1.esp' *much* earlier in your load order.  I recommend trying just before LCO_Framework.esp, to start.   
	13.  Rerun Synthesis.  Open it, click on the blue arrow down on the bottom left.
	14.  If you get an error saying 'Too Many Masters' when generating, then you need to move the 'Patcher 1' esp either up or down in your load order.  If the error was while generating patcher 1, then you need to move it lower.  If the error was generating pather 2, then move patcher 1 later.  Leave patcher 2 at the very end of your load order.  Keep re-running Synthesis until you get a good run with no errors.
	15.  Close Synthesis.
	16.  DO NOT bother setting the ESL flag on either of the two generated synthesis patches.  Yes, they can be easily eslified.  But the next time they're generated, Synthesis will create regular ESPs again.  Don't waste your time.
	17.  Start Skyrim, and test your new patches.  With any luck, all your NPCs will look exactly like they did before, and you will see no difference whatsoever.  Magic!
	
	Why are we going to all this trouble?  What does the HPH RaceMenu patcher do?  All it does it change the main race records to use High-Poly heads by default, rather than standard low-poly ones.  This is done *SOLELY* to ease character generation in a new game, as new characters will start with HP heads rather than ugly old low-poly ones.  But in order to get all the head meshes of the existing NPCs to still use the old low poly heads that they were built with, their records need to be patched, to explicitly add low-poly head parts that were previously assumed by default.
	
	Needless to say, this means patching virtually every NPC record in the game, save for those that were overwritten by HPH NPC overhauls. Which means patching a huge number of plugins - possibly more than 254, which is the maximum number of masters a single esp can have.  TPFZS is patching less than 254 esps, so it can get away with standard Synthesis generation.  By my load order adds lots of mods with new NPCs, and goes over the 254 limit.  (Note this had nothing to do with the limit of 254 esps; this is a limit on the number of *masters* listed in the header of a single esp, whether those masters are esps, esls, or espfes.)

	So, the get the master count down in the Synthesis-generated patches, we need to create multiple patches, each affecting only a fraction of the esps that need to be patched.   Fortunately, Synthesis makes this easy, in two ways.  First, a synthesis patch will ONLY look at plugins that precede it in the load order; thus, our patch 1 is somewhere in the middle, so it only patches the first N plugins, where N < 254.  Second, a synthesis patch will NOT patch things that don't need to be patched; thus, our patch 2 will ignore all the plugins already patched by patch 1.

	Yes, we need to create 2 different Synthesis patches, with two different names.  But this is easily done by creating two 'groups' of patchers, where each group creates a different patch.
	
	If you want to add more patchers in the future, then you almost certainly want to add them to patch group 2, which is at the end of the load order, and can affect every plugin in the load order.  Feel free to rename either patch group if you like; you can put patch group 2 back to simply 'Synthesis' if you want.  Whatever you name a group, that will be the name of the generated esp.  Definitely use as few groups as possible, so as not to use precious esp slots.
	
	Do we even *need* this Synthesis patch at all?  Not really.  If you're like me, and never create new characters from scratch, but simply use HPH presets downloaded from Nexus that look *way* better than anything I could create myself, then this whole HPH RaceMenuPatcher thing is totally pointless, and can be safely removed.  Recall, most of the work is patching NPCs so they *don't* look any different, despite the Race records being changed to use HighPoly heads by default, for convenience during character generation.  Peronsally, I plan to chuck the things, because I want the esp slots and don't care if HP heads are default.  But if you like creating lots of new characters from scratch, and want them all to use high-poly heads by default, your feelings may differ.

	Notes:  Mod of the Month April 2023
	DL: FloatingSwordFollower.zip 1.08 10 may 2023
		Skeever Daumbra Patch.7z  1.6 12 apr 2023
		XEDIT filter for finding suitable candidates for Daumbra's body (xEdit script)
	NOT REQUIRED BUT STRONGLY SUGGESTED:
		- Skeever﻿﻿﻿﻿ - Mod of the Month for April 2021, the follower with the most lines ever made (15 thousand and counting) adds a thousand lines more to comment and advice every step of the way for "There Is No Umbra" Chapters I and II (and Kerstyn herself recorded over a hundred new lines as well). It was an honor collaborating together for the patch. You can download it from the optional files section. See the video at: https://youtu.be/GkZQBq_3pcw﻿
		- Vibrant Weapons﻿ - Combined with a patch already included in the FOMOD, this will make her produce real light. Very cool. Don't forget to use the Power from that mod to enable effects on NPCs (note: if the light from Vibrant Weapons is too strong for you, there is now an alternative ENB Light﻿ patch from PraedythXVI also in the FOMOD installer. ENB Light is not as bright and works whether the sword is sheathed or not).
		- Disable Follower Collision﻿ - it's a beautiful piece of SKSE witchcraft so that you will never again be blocked by your own housecarl while backing out of a small room!
		Equipment Enchantment Fix﻿ - This may help you if sometimes her flames don't turn on.
		- Iconic's Azura's Star Dungeon Retexture﻿ - This will make your visuals match the Chapter II trailer. It's so gorgeous.
		Praedy's Soul Cairn - SE﻿ - Speaking of gorgeous, this makes Umbriel look amazing.
		- Combat Gameplay Overhaul﻿ - or any other similar mod that makes you lean in the direction in which you are moving. This will make the hoverboard riding look and feel gorgeous -and you can wield her one-handed.
		- Better Jumping SE﻿ - This will allow you to jump while in 'hoverboard' mode. Combined with CGO it makes for smooooth shock-absorption motion -see the video.
		- Your favorite camera mod - The combat custom animations are all 3rd person, but with some of these mods they can be 1st person too! 
		- There is no (CC) Umbra﻿ - A kind soul made a patch that resolves the lore conflict between this mod and the Creation Club's version. 
		- WIDeadBodyCleanupScript Crash Fix﻿ - Depending on your choices some vanilla NPCs may or may not die, and this mod addresses a vanilla bug that sometimes produced crashes when that happened.
		- Dragonactorscript infinite loop fix﻿ - Similar to above, this will probably save you some headaches with script lag and Papyrus.
	COMPATIBLITY
		- The FOMOD already includes some patches for minor things, like book covers, or other quests which also touch certain vanilla points -nothing huge.
		- PCEA: PCEA is fine, but make sure it doesn't overwrite 2hm_sprintforwardsword.hkx so that the DAR version wins over and you can sword-surf.
		- SkySA: I don't use it, but people in my discord say it works fine as long as you delete the SkySA 2-handed attacks and 2-handed sprint animations so you can use the ones from this mod.
		- MCO: I don't use it either, but a very friendly ape in the discord (he asked me to refer to him that way!) made an MCO patch which is included in the FOMOD, that uses Black's animation from mods Sswayed commissioned and gave persm for. Apologies I can't give technical support on it, since, again, I don't use MCO myself.
		- AFT, NFF, etc.: DO NOT import her into any follower management system. She has her own. Of course, you can have your other followers in your favorite follower management system; that's just fine for them -but not her. The NFF patch is no longer required -uninstall it if you were using it before.
		- The T'Skyrim patch is also no longer required -uninstall it if you were using it before. As of Chapter III, the mod no longer touches the Atronach Forge formlists, so it no longer needs that kind of patches. 
		- Immersive Citizens or similar mods which change the AI packages of vanilla NPCs: make sure my mod loads last in the load order. I can't stress this enough.
		- Synthesis Patcher﻿, Wyre Bash, Merges, etc: Do not include this mod. This mod doesn't merge well, it needs to be by itself.
		- Immersive Equipment Displays﻿ -Make sure to use the "Daumbra Exclude" json settings, included in the FOMOD (thanks Waddles!).

	Sunder and Wraithguard - Editable Vault Cell (Cell Bug Workaround)
	https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/59083
	Sunder and Wraithguard is unfortunately set up as an ESM flagged ESL, which means that any mod attempting to touch its new cell, or any of the linked references in Sightless Pit, cause the cell to break. This workaround creates a copy of the cell and repoints all necessary parts of the Creation, allowing other mods to edit the contents.

	Notes:  DO NOT ESLIFY!  The whole point of this mod is that it's not flagged ESL, thus allowing other mods to edit the cell.

	Notes: I have permission from original author (triptherift) to post this version, provided I NEVER upload it to Nexus Mods. By downloading this version you must also agree to this condition, NEVER upload it to Nexus Mods. Also, nothing contained in the mod can be used for paid modding sites, ever.

	Adds a shell-shocked and totally insane former soldier to the game.
	DL: main v Insane2 10 jul 2021
	LOOT: with other followers, after Kaidan
	Notes: Kels just wanders around Solitude, because she doesn't have any family to return home to. She goes to the tavern in the evening. She has no place to live, so some of her soldier friends that feel sorry for her let her sneak into Castle Dour at night. She sleeps by a fireplace in the dungeon.
	- Use a mod manager. Any one will do. The esp is esl flagged (espfe), one of the very few added voice line followers built that way. The assets are packed into a compressed archive to keep the mod footprint low. She is CBBE Slim based, but for crying out loud, don't ruin my day and put her into some silly bikini boob armor. Seriously. You have thousands of hyper-inflated T&A smash dolls to choose from for that. This chick is unwashed, smelly, ugly, and obnoxious. Why would you even bother?

	The Marrying Kind - Cinderella 1.2
	https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/55509
	A mod loosely inspired by the story Aschenputtel, by the Brothers Grimm. Based on a folk tale that has roots in many cultures around the world - stories of a simple, poor girl that dreams of a better future.
	DL: main 1.2 12 nov 2021
	Notes:
		- Cheap supermarket romance novel quality intro dialogue (You know - cringe-worthy 50 Shades stuff)
		- Different dialogue paths for male versus female suitors (aye, she's looking for a Prince, so females will initially fail, and will have to convince her)
		- The thrill of victory, or the agony of defeat (in love)
		- You only get one shot at catching her fancy, so don't mess up your opportunity - make wise choices
		- She can follow you, but has no skills or weapon, and is very timid, so you will have to protect her (this is by design, and no I won't change it)
		- Custom hand sculpted UNP-based body and textures
		- Custom outfit made just for her
		- Mod is archived (compressed bsa format) to keep the mod footprint low
		- Scripts are just small fire and forget fragments to move the story along (sources included)
		- When in follower mode, she will stay at whatever location you dismiss her at, as she has no home
		- As this uses the vanilla Marriage quest, when the option of where to live comes up, be sure to set YOUR home to live at, or you will have a big problem
		- Never, ever, open up a mod like this in the CK. Any save you make will generate new (very ugly) facegen files. Use xEdit. Seriously.
		- esp is flagged as esl (espfe)

	https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/45082
	A set of new Threesome sex animations for OStim. MMF and FFM included.
	Notes: Finding the animations in Manual mode
		To start a threesome scene in OStim, make sure you have OSex's Dual Wield plugin, then:
		- Start a 2 person scene -> Select sub actor tab (hit "9" by default) -> page right, press your body against him/her -> tab bottom (9, again), Invite someone to join 
		- These animations are sorted into 2 "trees", one for MMF animation and one for MFF animations.  The first bottom tab is the Sub actors menu, which is the MMF scenes. The second bottom tab is the third actor's menu, with the MFF scenes contained within it. You can list them all quickly by using OSearch and searching " " (an empty space) while a threesome scene is running. This will pull up a list of all threesome animations (make sure you are using the latest version of OStim and OSearch).
		- Want the roles flipped around in FFM anims? go to Osa's "arrange" menu (press the enter key on your numpad) and flip the position between the sub and the male two actor (the one with the yellow circle). then proceed to the animations
		
	OCum Ascended - Cum and Orgasm Mechanics for OStim 2.2

	OCum Ascended is an overhaul and rewrite of OCum, an OStim addon which adds cum effects, physical cum projectiles, womb size, cum inflation mechanics, female squirting during orgasms, and many other orgasm features. Fully replaces the original OCum, as mods that require OCum will work with OCum Ascended out of the box.
	DL: main 2.2 23 nov 2022
	Notes: - OCum Ascended now has its own separate MCM menu with new and more options. Do NOT use the OCum MCM options in the OStim MCM Addons tab. They won't work! It's highly recommended to also use OCum Ascended - Cum and Orgasm Mechanics for OStim - Settings Loader, courtesy of MaskedRPGFan!

	DL main 1.0 10 mar 2023
	
NEW MOD - ESLIFICATION
	Caesia Ostim Patch 1.0 - KZ eslified esp replacer
	
INSTALL:
	OPubes 1.0
	https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/64151/
	Addon for OBody that distributes female pubic hair textures from a number of packs. You can easily create patches in the form of JSON files too.
	DL: 1.0 23 feb 2022
	
	Naughty Voices for OStim 1.4
	https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/74765
	This is the next-generation replacement for OVoice. It provides additional features and superior playback performance.
	DL: main 1.4 29 nov 2022
	- Like OVoice, Naughty Voices causes actors to use their natural voices in OStim scenes.  Currently, like OVoice, this is limited to OSA/OStim's actor2, females in the sub role.  Unlike OVoice, it will work on a female player character and you can even choose which voice you want your character to use in an MCM.  If you do not choose, it will use your character's natural voice (yes, the game assigns your character a voice based on race).
	- This version of Naughty Voices is compatible with ColdSun's Vayne and Coralyn.
	
	OMerchants - OStim merchants with benefits 1.0
	https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/80141
	An OStim addon that allows merchants to give Dragonborn a temporary discount in exchange for sex.
	DL: main 1.0 06 dec 2022
	- The mod adds a few seduction lines. Approach the merchant and select the randomized dialogue line. If the seduction is successful (50% chance by default, customizable in MCM), the merchant will follow you for a short time, so you can choose a more intimate place for the OStim scene. You can also turn off the follow feature in the MCM.
	- If the merchant orgasmed, the shop menu will open with applied discount after the scene ends. This effect stacks with other vanilla and modded speech effects (Ordinator perks for example). You need to wait for cooldown to end before you try to approach a merchant again.
	
	OAroused 1.2
	https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/57232
	Arousal mechanics in OStim. Stat buffs, changes to scene length when aroused, and more.
	D: 1.4 18 oct 2021
	- Arousal and the algorithm: Arousal goes up for everyone in the game all of the time. Each NPC has a unique arousal-gain speed, so it's different for everyone (the player's is always the same). To simulate off-screen sex or masturbation, if you have not been near an NPC for several days, their arousal will reset to something else. Max arousal for the player is usually reached in 4-5 days  with no orgasms
	- Arousal drops when a character has an orgasm in a OStim scene. The longer the build-up to the orgasm, the greater the arousal release will be. This means if you start a scene and speed up the scene to max speed and quickly finish, you will have less of an arousal drop (but still a sizable one)
	- Arousal also slightly rises over the course of an OStim scene. Also, if a character finishes a scene without orgasming, their arousal spikes considerably. This also means that kisses from ORomance raise arousal a lot.
	- Special scene-ending feature: You can enable a setting in the MCM to change how OStim scenes can end with OAroused installed. With "Require low arousal to end scene" enabled, OStim scenes will prefer not to end until your arousal reaches 0. Specifically, if you have "End on Dom Orgasm" enabled, and your player character is the dom actor, the end event for you will not fire until your arousal is low. The same happens if your character is the sub actor with "End on Sub Orgasm" enabled. With this feature, if your character enters a scene with high arousal and orgasm doesn't empty it completely, your character will continue on with the scene until they're not longer aroused.
	- On-screen bar: By pressing right-ctrl, a bar similar to OCum's will appear to show you how aroused your character is. Key remappable.
	- Raising nearby NPC's arousal with nudity & OStim scenes: If your character or anyone else sees an OStim scene in progress, their arousal will skyrocket.
	- Optionally, if your player is naked or is wearing armor with the EroticArmor keyword attached, nearby NPCs will become more aroused as well. This feature is disabled by default, since it must do small script polls when your character is naked (they are still light on performance) . Which brings us to performance
	- Performance: Without the above nudity feature on, OAroused does not perform any script polling or use any script cloaks. OAroused only runs it's single script during OStim scenes. Beyond that it only runs a brief check on the player every 6 in-game hours to see if stat buffs need to be updated. OAroused was designed for performance and long-term stability, and uses an almost identical stat system to OCum, which tracked semen and semen generation for all NPCs like how OAroused tracks arousal.
	
	OVirginity 1.3.1
	https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/45563

	OVirginity Reflowered 2.1.0
	https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/77929
	OVirginity Reflowered is an overhaul and rewrite of OVirginity, an OStim addon which adds a female virginity system with visual and sound effects. ESP flagged ESL, so it won't take a slot in your load order. Fully replaces the original OVirginity, as mods that require OVirginity will work with OVirginity Reflowered out of the box.
	DL: main 2.1 06 nov 2022
		OVirginity Reflowered JSON Configuration File 2.1 03 nov 2022
	Requires: OCum Ascended
	- OVirginity Reflowered now has its own separate MCM menu with new and more options. Do NOT use the OVirginity MCM options in the OStim MCM Addons tab. They won't work! It is highly recommended that you also use OVirginity Reflowered - Settings Loader so you can keep your settings across different characters.

	ORomance 1.8
	https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/48564
	Extensive new dating and seduction mechanics, a brand new user interface, prostitution mechanics, cheating mechanics, and countless new features, built for OStim
	DL: main 1.8 18 oct 2021
	- No, don't ESL-flag this mod
	- To start ORomance, simply approach an NPC and press the ORomance hotkey while facing them. This will start a special dialogue with the ORomance menu available. You now have many options available to you
	- ORomance is a massive mod, there's no way to explain all of it's new features here, but here's the big ones:
	- Dating, romance, and seduction mechanics in Skyrim. Loosely based off of classic dating sims
	- A brand new UI built from the ground up to make navigating ORomance's many options a breeze
	- A new relationship type, girlfriend or boyfriend, acts as an intermediate between friends and marriage
	- divorce/breakup/cheating/multiple partners/threesomes, all features in ORomance
	- EVERY NPC is romancable/seducable/marriable, even those NPCs added in new mods (some NPCs may be hard to get, see below)
	- Brand new custom stats (over 10) and personalities procedurally generated for each npc, because Skyrim's relationship mechanics were far too basic
	- NPCs have an opinion/"memory" of you that will fade over time for small actions, but they will remember some things you do with them forever
	- Loads of new interaction options with NPCs
	- Prostitution, where you can pay different prices for different sex acts
	- Ultra-tight OStim integration, your actions inside sex scenes affect your relationship
	- Followers like you the more you travel with them
	- Optional NPC sexualities (heterosexual/bisexual/homosexual) that affects their preferences in the player
	- Loads of small immersive tweaks that tie into the game's vanilla systems. Becoming a thane makes you more popular around town? Of course. Not being orc-kin makes seducing orcs harder? Absolutely. Doing quests for NPCs makes starting relationships with them easier? Yep.
	- Heavy emphasis on small immersive features
	
	
	OProstitution 1.4
	https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/64148
	Adds the ability to work as a prostitute
	DL: main 1.4 
	Requirements:  OAroused, OCum, ORomance, OStim, OVirginity
	- Make sure you have installed OAroused and OProstitution correctly. OAroused is a dependency and OProstitution should overwrite it. Make sure OProstitution wins conflicts and is lower in your load order than OAroused.
	- Looking to play as a prostitute? OProstitution brings many new hours of gameplay and plenty of roleplay opportunity. Based loosely on the famous Your Market Stall mod, you'll be setting up your own sex business and completing detailed jobs.
	- The Lantern
	- At a forge, you can craft a Prostitution Lantern. This special lantern glows light red, and is used to signal to customers that you are a prostitute. After crafting the lantern, open your inventory and drop it on the ground and it will magically set itself up. You can move it again by pressing E on it
	- With a lantern placed down, as long as you are within about 30 meters of it, clients will know you're a prostitute and begin approaching you with sex offers.
	- Prostitute sex
	- Most clients will have specific sexual requests that you must fulfill during the act to receive payment. You can view all active requests by holding the ORomance key during sex. There is a large variety of requests clients may have. Some clients have special requests they can make too. Clients may refuse to pay if you do not complete all of their requests.
	- Working for a store owner, licensing, and prostitution in public
	- Prostitution is illegal in Skyrim without a license. You can purchase a license at the lantern for 2500 septims, however, early on you may want to work inside an inn, or maybe even a store, where you won't be caught not having a license. You can set up shop inside any store, inn, or business in Skyrim and the store owner will automatically take a cut of your profits. The amount they take is dependent on their ORomance personality. A small few may take the entirety of your profits. Note that on the OProstitution screen, the payout shown already has the owner's cut deducted.
	- Misc features Having your lantern in the same area for a long period of time will "warm up" that area, and your approach rate will increase, since people know where to find you easily.
	- Recommended mods Since this mod has heavy roleplay potential and involves hanging around one area, I recommend a few mods that may improve the experience:
		SkyrimSouls, so time passes while in your inventory
		Mods that let you place down furniture like Campfire addons
		YourMarketStall if you want to run a shop alongside your current business
		Mods that add more npcs
		Mods that make NPC AI more complex and travel around more often

	Amorous Adventures PLUS - OStim and OpenSex Edition 1.1.0
	https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/76046
	A rework and rebuild of the original Amorous Adventures, now ported to OStim using OpenSex animations!
	DL: main v1.1.0
	- It is highly recommended that you load the Amorous Adventures PLUS esp plugin within the first 128 plugins in your load order. That is including ESMs, ESLs and ESP-FEs. If you find that too difficult, make sure it does not go over plugin position 200th in your load order.  This is due to a very possible Skyrim engine bug, where mods which add many dialogues (such as quest mods like Amorous Adventures) will have their dialogues disappearing if you load them very late in your load order. So please, load Amorous Adventures PLUS as early as possible to avoid the disappearing dialogue bug.

	Twins 1.11
	https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/10598-twins/
	Meet Danielle and Dahlia, twin sisters from Cyrodiil. They have come to Skyrim for some adventure. Unfortunately for them their adventure has gone sideways. They have been captured by bandits and are being held for who-knows-what nefarious purpose (this is LoversLab after all). If you choose to rescue them they will be happy to follow you and add to your adventures.
	- They can be found in the last indoor cell of Silent Moons Camp
	- Both will follow you but neither is marriageable (see Notes below)
	- Danielle is a berserker and prefers two-handed weapons and heavy armor
	- Dahlia is a combat archer and prefers bows and light armor
	- Regardless of your follower framework neither should impact your stealth
	- Both have perks in their respective weapon/armor
	- Both are naked when you find them so they have no "recurring" weapons or armors that pop up when you least want them
	- ESP file.
	- DO NOT INSTALL until eslified.  may be an LE format mod

	DL: MQ104PlayerScript Fix - VSmO Edition 1.02 13 may 2023
	- The vanilla MQ104PlayerScript performs several checks to advance quest stages for the Dragon Rising quest. One of these checks is entirely nonsensical: after giving the Dragonstone to Farengar, if the player goes outside Whiterun, the first stage of Dragon Rising ("talk to Jarl Balgruuf") is auto-completed by the game. This script fix corrects this silly error by silly Bethesda and makes it so the player can safely adventure outside Whiterun without having the game autocomplete a quest stage, because that's just silly.
	Mod Order: early, with other fixes, after Vanilla Script (micro) Optimizations

TEST:
	Boot the game.  Make sure it runs.
	Uhoh.  CTD during MCM initialization in opening room.

	Crash log in overwrite/NetScriptFramework/Crash  suggest trouble is in evgSIRENROOTthecausepatch.esp
	
REINSTALL:
	Suspect possible problem due to scrips/assets between SSE versions.   Sirenroot needs 1.6.640 AE assets, including scripts.  I'm going to reinstall my StockGame as 1.6.640, then run the downgrade patcher to create a 'Best of Both Worlds' install.

In no case do I want to blame the original author of the mod, he did great job, but bethesda engine is a buggy mess but we have to deal with this somehow.

	DL: Kozakowy's Mythic Dawn Priestess Outfit CBBE - SSE - ESL  1.2.1 15 may 2021
	- Q. [For CBBE Users] Why do my hands look different?
		A. The Mythic Dawn Priestess Outfit uses a custom body sculpt, which is based on the CBBE body from Skyrim Legendary Edition. There are changes in the mesh, including it's shape, between CBBE Legendary Edition and CBBE Special Edition. When equipping the Mythic Dawn Priestess Outfit your character's body is also changed out for the custom sculpted CBBE Legendary Edition body, which has a different mesh shape around the wrists, resulting in a large gap between the hands and the arms. To fix this gap, the CBBE Legendary Edition hands have been included as a part of the 'body swap' when equipping the Mythic Dawn Priestess outfit.
