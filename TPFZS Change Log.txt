Disabled:	DXMCO - Creeatures
	My dog companion wasnt animating when he walked, just gliding as a statue.  Disabling DXMCO - Creatures fixes problem

Disabled:		Root Builder
	Moved to a StockGame installation of SSE, kept within the base TPFZS MO2 folder.
	Due to my MO2 crashing a lot on installing/removing mods, RB kept messing up, copying things to overwrite, hanging, etc.
	Plus, there was always a 5 second delay starting or exiting the game.
	So, for stability and speed, moved to a TPFDE-like 'StockGame' installation.
	Create a 'StockGame' folder in the TPFZS main MO folder.
	Fill it with a 1.5.97 game, including data, esms, bsas, and ESPECIALLY CC content.
	Look at the 'Data/Root' folder inside MO right hand Data pane, and copy all files listed to the new StockGame folder
	Edit all the MO executables (or create new ones) to point to new location in StockGame.
	Nemesis needs a new ini, either reinstall or copy existing ini to a new mod folder.
	Change Nemesis_Engine\nemesis.ini :  SkyrimDataDirectory=auto
	Nemesis will update that to the new location after first run.
	Add to SSEdit executable command line: -D:"<TPFDX folder>\\StockGame\\data"

	SPID - NFF - Add Ignore Token to CustomAI Followers

	v1.0.13
	Mod Order: N/A
	Notes: Add NFF Ignore Tokens to custom followers that use their own AI (just another Quality of Life minifix)
		This mod aims to supply with a vetted SPID distribution-list for followermods and/or NPCs that are NOT to be imported into NFF.  Blocking is done by means of using SPID to distribute the 'NFF Ignore Token' into the respective followers inventory, basically stopping the player from importing it into the NFF framework (at least not without explicitly cleaning the follower inventory first).
		Handles all the cool follower mods, practically a list of the best ones around.

	Relationship Dialogue Overhaul - RDO SE
	https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1187
	Adds over 5,000 lines of completely voiced dialogue for NPCs using the original voices. Friends, followers, spouses, rivals, and others have much more to say. All default voices now have follower dialogue. Also fixes dialogue bugs and restores cut dialogue that has never been heard before!
	Download:  Main - Relationship Dialogue Overhaul - RDO Final
		Optional - RDO - CRF and USSEP Patches Final
	BUG:  MO2 hung on installing RDO main.   Needed to kill process.   On restart and re-install replace, CTD.  Also CTD on reinstall merge.
		All data seems to be installed, but MO2 version # is wrong; suspect problem occurs when updating metadata/accessing nexus.
		Temp solution:  force-update version number.
		MO2 CTD on installing patch.
	MODIFY:  temporarily disable RDO - CRF + USSEP Patch.esp, as CRF is not yet installed
		Both the new patches are ESLify candidates.  Open Wrye Smash, left click on them, set ESL flag

	Replacer for Lilly the courier replacer
	https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/51487
	Requires assets from Mona Follower
	Install: enable ONLY Lilly Replacer Default Equipment.esp.
		Disable Lilly Replacer Custom Equipment.esp
	ESLify:  Set ESL flag in File Header, uding either SSEEdit or Wrye Smash
	SSEEdit:  Clean Masters
		Set ESL Flag in File Header
	
	
PATCH REQUIRED:

INSTALL:
	Mona Follower SE
	https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/13758
	Download: Mona Follower SE - Naked Edition ESP-FE v1.3
	Install:  Disable esp.   Only need assets for Lilly replacer.
	
ESLify:
	Lilly - A fully-voiced female courier replacer and follower
	Notes:  only do this AFTER installing Appearance Replacer
	Procedure: 
		Highly recommend installing ESLifyEverything in MO2 folder, because you will need a different setup for each MO2 installation.
		In MO2, create an empty mod named 'ESLifyEverything Output'.  Enable it.
		In MO2 Excutables menu, add ESLifyEverything.  Check 'Create files in mod' option, point to 'ESLifyEverything Output'
		Edit ESLifyEverything/AppSettings.json.  Update file paths to correct locations.  My version looks like:
			"XEditFolderPath": "c:\\Portable Apps\\xEdit",
			"DataFolderPath": "C:\\TPFZS\\Stock Game\\Data",
			"OutputFolder": "c:\\TPFZS\\mods\\ESLifyEverything Output",
			"MO2": {
				"MO2Support": true,
				"OutputPluginsToSeperateFolders": true,
				"MO2ModFolder": "c:\\TPFZS\\mods"
			}
			
		Start SSEEdit on Seraphim - PrettyCourier.esp and Lilly Replacer Default Equipment.esp
		On Seraphim - Pretty Courier.esp, Compact FormIDs for ESL, then set ESL flag in File Header.
		Exit SSEEdit, saving both altered esps
		Run ESLifyEverything.exe.  This is most easily done from MO2, but can also be done externally.  It does not use MO's virtual file system.
