Disabled:	DXMCO - Creeatures
	My dog companion wasnt animating when he walked, just gliding as a statue.  Disabling DXMCO - Creatures fixes problem

Disabled:		Root Builder
	Moved to a StockGame installation of SSE, kept within the base TPFZS MO2 folder.
	Due to my MO2 crashing a lot on installing/removing mods, RB kept messing up, copying things to overwrite, hanging, etc.
	Plus, there was always a 5 second delay starting or exiting the game.
	So, for stability and speed, moved to a TPFDE-like 'StockGame' installation.
	Create a 'StockGame' folder in the TPFZS main MO folder.
	Fill it with a 1.5.97 game, including data, esms, bsas, and ESPECIALLY CC content.
	Look at the 'Data/Root' folder inside MO right hand Data pane, and copy all files listed to the new StockGame folder
	Edit all the MO executables (or create new ones) to point to new location in StockGame.
	Nemesis needs a new ini, either reinstall or copy existing ini to a new mod folder.
	Change Nemesis_Engine\nemesis.ini :  SkyrimDataDirectory=auto
	Nemesis will update that to the new location after first run.
	Add to SSEdit executable command line: -D:"<TPFDX folder>\\StockGame\\data"

	SPID - NFF - Add Ignore Token to CustomAI Followers

	v1.0.13
	Mod Order: N/A
	Notes: Add NFF Ignore Tokens to custom followers that use their own AI (just another Quality of Life minifix)
		This mod aims to supply with a vetted SPID distribution-list for followermods and/or NPCs that are NOT to be imported into NFF.  Blocking is done by means of using SPID to distribute the 'NFF Ignore Token' into the respective followers inventory, basically stopping the player from importing it into the NFF framework (at least not without explicitly cleaning the follower inventory first).
		Handles all the cool follower mods, practically a list of the best ones around.

ESLify:
	Lilly - A fully-voiced female courier replacer and follower
	Notes:  only do this AFTER installing Appearance Replacer
	Procedure: 
		Highly recommend installing ESLifyEverything in MO2 folder, because you will need a different setup for each MO2 installation.
		In MO2, create an empty mod named 'ESLifyEverything Output'.  Enable it.
		In MO2 Excutables menu, add ESLifyEverything.  Check 'Create files in mod' option, point to 'ESLifyEverything Output'
		Edit ESLifyEverything/AppSettings.json.  Update file paths to correct locations.  My version looks like:
			"XEditFolderPath": "c:\\Portable Apps\\xEdit",
			"DataFolderPath": "C:\\TPFZS\\Stock Game\\Data",
			"OutputFolder": "c:\\TPFZS\\mods\\ESLifyEverything Output",
			"MO2": {
				"MO2Support": true,
				"OutputPluginsToSeperateFolders": true,
				"MO2ModFolder": "c:\\TPFZS\\mods"
			}
			
		Start SSEEdit on Seraphim - PrettyCourier.esp and Lilly Replacer Default Equipment.esp
		On Seraphim - Pretty Courier.esp, Compact FormIDs for ESL, then set ESL flag in File Header.
		Exit SSEEdit, saving both altered esps
		Run ESLifyEverything.exe.  This is most easily done from MO2, but can also be done externally.  It does not use MO's virtual file system.

MOD EDIT:
	Even Better Quest Objectives
	Goal: Put scripts in a BSA.   Use BSArchPro.exe from https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/63243.  Hide loose scripts.
	Why:  EBQO scripts must override those in USSEP, but I want the overridden my scripts in other mods, such as Alternative College Entry.  Unfortunately, scripts in ACE are in a BSA file, while the EBQO scripts are loose, which means they will *always* override the ACE versions.  Rather than unpacking the ACE scripts, the proper thing to do is put the EBQO scripts into a BSA, which is how the mod should have been packaged in the first place.
	This means that if EBQO gets reinstalled, this BSA packing will have to be done again.

	Clouds all over - All in one 1.4
	https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/86848?tab=files
	Download: Clouds AIO 1.4
	Notes: No performance impact (winterhold is the heaviest).  Lod friendly.  Clouds are full lod - you do not need to generate or re-generate lod for this. You do not need to disable this mod to generate lod with dyndolod. They are visible from very far away.  Load order - Fully compatible. Use with any weather mod. Place this above water mods. Or you get water seams. Nothing else needs to be done. If in doubt, place this high (low priority) in your load order in regards with other mods that edit worldspaces. This is highly compatible, and I could not find anything else besides whats in the misc files.
	LOOT:  before RW2.  preferably very early, make patches as needed.  Before WACCF
