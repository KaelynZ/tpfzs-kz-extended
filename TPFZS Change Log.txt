Disabled:	DXMCO - Creeatures
	My dog companion wasnt animating when he walked, just gliding as a statue.  Disabling DXMCO - Creatures fixes problem

Disabled:		Root Builder
	Moved to a StockGame installation of SSE, kept within the base TPFZS MO2 folder.
	Due to my MO2 crashing a lot on installing/removing mods, RB kept messing up, copying things to overwrite, hanging, etc.
	Plus, there was always a 5 second delay starting or exiting the game.
	So, for stability and speed, moved to a TPFDE-like 'StockGame' installation.
	Create a 'StockGame' folder in the TPFZS main MO folder.
	Fill it with a 1.5.97 game, including data, esms, bsas, and ESPECIALLY CC content.
	Look at the 'Data/Root' folder inside MO right hand Data pane, and copy all files listed to the new StockGame folder
	Edit all the MO executables (or create new ones) to point to new location in StockGame.
	Nemesis needs a new ini, either reinstall or copy existing ini to a new mod folder.
	Change Nemesis_Engine\nemesis.ini :  SkyrimDataDirectory=auto
	Nemesis will update that to the new location after first run.
	Add to SSEdit executable command line: -D:"<TPFDX folder>\\StockGame\\data"

	SPID - NFF - Add Ignore Token to CustomAI Followers

	v1.0.13
	Mod Order: N/A
	Notes: Add NFF Ignore Tokens to custom followers that use their own AI (just another Quality of Life minifix)
		This mod aims to supply with a vetted SPID distribution-list for followermods and/or NPCs that are NOT to be imported into NFF.  Blocking is done by means of using SPID to distribute the 'NFF Ignore Token' into the respective followers inventory, basically stopping the player from importing it into the NFF framework (at least not without explicitly cleaning the follower inventory first).
		Handles all the cool follower mods, practically a list of the best ones around.

	Relationship Dialogue Overhaul - RDO SE
	https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1187
	Adds over 5,000 lines of completely voiced dialogue for NPCs using the original voices. Friends, followers, spouses, rivals, and others have much more to say. All default voices now have follower dialogue. Also fixes dialogue bugs and restores cut dialogue that has never been heard before!
	Download:  Main - Relationship Dialogue Overhaul - RDO Final
		Optional - RDO - CRF and USSEP Patches Final
	BUG:  MO2 hung on installing RDO main.   Needed to kill process.   On restart and re-install replace, CTD.  Also CTD on reinstall merge.
		All data seems to be installed, but MO2 version # is wrong; suspect problem occurs when updating metadata/accessing nexus.
		Temp solution:  force-update version number.
		MO2 CTD on installing patch.
	MODIFY:  temporarily disable RDO - CRF + USSEP Patch.esp, as CRF is not yet installed
		Both the new patches are ESLify candidates.  Open Wrye Smash, left click on them, set ESL flag
	LOOT:  Before TCIY The Choice is Yours (preferred but not required)
		After ICAIO (once it gets installed)
		After FCO Follower Commentary Overhaul
		After GDO Guard Dialog Overhaul
		After Mirai - the Girl with the Dragon Heart (once it gets installed)
