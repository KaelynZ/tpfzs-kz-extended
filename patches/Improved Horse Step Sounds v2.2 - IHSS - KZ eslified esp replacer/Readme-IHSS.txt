Improved Horsestep Sounds v2.2 © 2018 Crystan

-> Nexus exclusive mod <-

Changelog:

v2.2
- SK Special Edition Update (Thanks a lot to TechAngel85 for updating the esp to Skyrim SE)

v2.1
- priority fix

v2
- Modfied sounds
- Added "saddle sounds"

--------------------------------------

This mod improves the "hoovestep" sounds of the horses by adding "sound sets" for different grounds.
That means your horse will have different step sounds for surfaces like snow, dirt, stone etc.

Like in all my sound mods, every sound of this mod is completly self made (recorded and edited) and i put a lot of work in them.
I even had to think about how to make hoovestep sounds without a horse. ;)

Currently there are six sound sets:

Stone, Dirt, Grass, Gravel, Snow, Wood

It should be compatible with every horse mod.

Installation:
Use Nexus Mod Manager.
